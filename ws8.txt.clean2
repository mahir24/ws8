N this boook was a great one that you could learn from. it not only teaches the imponrtance of family and their values but it also deals with basic issues that teens and some kids even deal with.  this book is about 4 best friends who are for the first time in their lives spending their summer apart. one day they are all in one of the girls rooms and finds a pair of pants that were tucked away in her closet.  once all four  of them try them on they realize that there is really something special about these pants.  seeming as how all 4 girls are differnt shapes and sizes and somehow the pants fit all of them,  they realize that these pants were the start of something special.  immediatley following they decided to make up certian rules abut the pants such as you must write the best thing u did while wearing the pants over your summer on the right leg and also some silly things such as to \\"never pick yuor nose while wearing the pants.\\"  this book follows the girls throuh their summers in differnt places of the world and through all of the different obstacles that life takes them through. it can really teach you alot not only about what is going on around you but most imporntantly about yuorself.  i would give this book 4 stars and would reccommend it to anyone who seems the slihgtest bit interested.
N If you are looking for something to stimulate your brain, this isn't it.  However, if you are just looking for a good laugh, you'll enjoy The Bad Girl's Guide.  It's funny and light, and definitely a good way to pass a little bit of time.
N never read it-a young relative idicated he liked it and somehow my name popped upon this--no more to say
N Though she is honored to be Chicago Woman of the Year, Victoria Colby-Camp is more euphoric over the mental improvement that her son Jim has shown recently especially since he and Tasha North fell in love.  Jim was snatched almost twenty years ago when he was seven and turned into the killing Seth whose goal was to murder Victoria for abandoning him.  However, her elation would turn to despair if she knew Seth resurfaced and started to rape a pregnant Tasha.<br /><br />Former military strategist Daniel Marks is in town complements of the Colby Agency that wants to hire him.  Also in Chicago is Emily Hastings whose father a veteran homicide detective was murdered.  She finds letters linking her dad to Victoria, the woman's long ago murdered first husband James, and her dad's first partner Marelyn Rutland that confuses her.  Soon she will meet Daniel and they will be embroiled in the COLBY CONSPIRACY that goes back almost two decades ago.<br /><br />Though the subplots can become confusing at first, once the audience comprehends how this complex superb suspense thriller starts to come together, they will want more Colby Agency tales; (see FILES FROM THE COLBY AGENCY: THE BODYGUARD'S BABY PROTECTIVE CUSTODY).  The ensemble cast is solid as fans will feel with Victoria who has overcome so much tragedy, hope Jim \\"defeats\\" Seth with Tasha at his side, and root for Daniel and Emily to make it while wondering what really happened two decades ago.  A final twist marks a strong Webb of deceit tale that showcases a fine author on her A-game.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
N Review based on a cursory examination by University of Phoenix students in Philosophy 251.  <br />We have found the book to be well organized, and detailed. The structure placed the information in an easy to read and presentable manner. <br />The use of strong and sound proofs by experiment and examples supported the overall logic of reasoning in a clear and concise manner. <br />We have found the book to be well thought out and laid out so the reader can learn and follow what is being explained. <br />
N My only complaint is that this book was a bit repetative, and Holden's vocabulary only consists of 4 words: sonuvabitch, goddamn, lousy and phony. It was still quite humorous and the actual story was interesting.<br /><br />It was easy to read and to relate to, so you should pick it up if you're looking for a fun read. Some people complain about the lack of a plot, but to understand this book you need to read deeper into it. It's actually a lot more than some annoying kid's list of complaints about life.<br /><br />The story is about Holden Caulfield's coming of age and realizing that growing up is not a process that can be stopped. He had a lousy childhood, as he puts it, and wants to save other children from going though the things he experienced in his life. He is telling the story from a mental institution, which he was placed in after returning home from the fourth Prep school he had been kicked out of. He flashes back to the events leading up to his arrival at his home and tells the story of those 3 days.
N This book is chilling and depressing indeed, though very well written and sprinkled with frequent humor.  I was sort of surprised however by the comment in Publisher's Weekly which said that \\"PW suspects that many of those buyers will be disappointed. Ehrenreich can't deliver the promised story because she never managed to get employed in the 'midlevel corporate world' she wanted to analyze.\\"  I never viewed that as being the \\"promised story\\" in the first place.  To me, the primary point of the book was to describe what it was like to actually try to ENTER that world in the first place rather than describing what life was like when she got there--and that she did.  In fact, I actually thought that she \\"lucked out\\" in a sense by having the bizarre, surreal experiences she did--not only did it make for more entertaining and more thought-provoking reading, but in my mind, if she HAD obtained a job right away, it would have taken away the whole raison d'etre of the book.  It would have been a completely different book in which she merely described her (presumably) boring mid-level corporate job, which probably would have been the same from day to day.  Thus, at least for purposes of writing the book, I think she was \\"lucky\\" that things worked out the way they did.  As for the reader who criticized her for not taking the \\"jobs\\" offered by AFLAC and Mary Kay, I thought those comments were bizarre.  I agree with Ms. Ehrenreich's point in that \\"jobs\\" such as these in which the employer offers no salary, no benefits, no office, no help and essentially takes no risk whatsoever can hardly be considered jobs in the traditional sense she was seeking.  In any event, it's really a pretty scary and depressing book, but one which I recommend.
N When looking for &lt;a href=\\"[...]\\">lock picking books&lt;/a>, this one is very informative. It will give one great ideas on opening padlocks, but the language is very basic, no frills here. This is not a romance novel, it's how to open locks without keys, and that's it. You will learn what you need to here. But you should always seek out more knowledge.
Y Never been much for enjoying history, but the style, brevity, and choice of subject matter come together very nicely in this book.
N If you enjoy a well told yarn of intrigue told so skillfully you are not able to predict the ending, a really good who-done-it, this is for you.
N I thoroughly enjoyed reading Faith is a verb by Chris Goodrich. The book covers facts regarding the history of the organization Habitat for Humanity and the author's experiences volunteering. Goodrich writes about the places, the people, and the volunteers he has encountered during his five-year experience with Habitat for Humanity. The author speaks straight from the heart, some of which brought tears to my eyes, some of sadness, some of laughter. Even through all the heart-wrenching sights, Goodrich and his crew persevere, regardless of the obstacles they face. Goodrich's experiences include traveling around the world, from America to London from London to Paraguay even getting lost in the Sierra, Faith is a Verb, is a fantastic read. In addition, the book opens a person's eyes and heart to the devastation and suffering that many see everyday of their lives. The book puts into perspective just how lucky we are even though we may not think so; it made me not only look at my ethics and values but also encouraged me to pick up that hammer.
Y If you are stumped for the perfect gift to bring to your dinner host, to give to your dinner guests, or for any other small gift occasion, Furry Logic is the answer.  Everyone loves this book.
N Whether intentional or not, this book's audience is the former or current military member.  But if you have read and enjoyed works such as the first two volumes of \\"Roots of Strategy\\", you should have no trouble following this book.    The author successfully shows that military personnel have mixed feelings about war.  Although he addresses behavior in the midst of battle, the author seems more interested in the views about war held by those outside war itself, i.e., those who had not yet experienced it and those who were looking backward in retrospect.  How those people felt in the midst of the madness is almost certainly different from how they anticipated or how they adjusted their feelings afterwards.  I think this \\"flavor\\" derives from his personal-interview-and-historical-research approach.  I do not see this as a negative but rather staying within his scope of knowledge and expertise.    The review titled \\"Flawed work of a historian with no sociological credibility\\" seems too harshly critical.  Perhaps this reviewer expected a highly technical, in-depth psychological approach.  As a note: page 58 cites S.L.A. Marshall as stating that only \\"some 15 per cent of American infantrymen fired.\\"  True, the subject of women in the military is barely broached.  However, in all fairness, the author never pretends to have extensive knowledge about how women react in battle and simply doesn't go there.  Perhaps that is a deficiency of character, but not of the book.  I get the feeling that this review didn't find what he wanted and then \\"skimmed\\" the book without thinking into what was being presented.      Although now much more interested in peace studies, I enjoyed reading this book.  I found a number of passages that shed light on where I have been and where I seek to go.  I don't see this as a pro-military book although at times it may seem so.  I characterize it as an honest endeavor to address and understand some of the difficult questions that most of us have concerning death and killing in war-time.
N Temple to the wind is a riveting account of the Reliance story. I would also put it right up there with Seabiscuit and In the Heart of the Sea. The book is expertly written and extremely well researched. I found the biographical material about Herreshoff, Barr and Lipton very interesting. I especially enjoyed the fast paced play by play action of the races between Reliance and Shamrock III. I highly recommend Temple to the Wind.
Y At last... a comprehensive visual compendium of the most celebrated artistic promotional film marketing campaign worldwide... almost.  You would think that the opulent Mr. Sansweet would have in his possession every single poster to have ever rolled off the printing press for this unprecedented franchise but several of my favorite foreign one-sheets, daybills, banners and bus stop posters are notably missing.  Does this mean that Mr. Sansweet has not aquired all of them in his envious collection of Star Wars memorabilia?  Not likely.  Chances are he has every single one of them... locked away somewhere within the bowels of his coveted archives.  Most notably absent is the lack of reference material specifically promoting Revenge of the Sith and would seem to indicate that this book was completed and ready to be published just prior to the film's theatrical exhibition, but there is a plethora of wonderful international promotional material such as the six character U.K. bus stop posters that are much more visually exciting than the disappointing U.S. domestic ad campaign that demands to be published.  This can only mean that another volume must be sure to follow.  Still, there are enough international poster variations out there to keep collectors like myself and presumably Mr. Sansweet himself scouring the farthest reaches of the globe and the galaxy for years to come.
N I find \\"Photoshop  for Nature Photographers : A Workshop in a Book\\" to be a great book to add to your PhotoShop library.  It adds some great insight by several of the world's best known nature photographers.  Any book that has instructional information from John Shaw, Arthur Morris, Charles Glatzer, and Joe McDonald is well worth the investment. <br /> <br />One of the most difficult aspects of PhotoShop for me has been the effective use of curves.  Tim and Ellen do a much better job at helping with this complex matter than any other book I have read. <br /> <br />The effective utilization of PhotoShop requires as much of an artistic approach as it does as workflow approach.  Tim and Ellen do a very good job of fully developing a great workflow while introducing their own artistic approach. <br /> <br />No one book can every include all the aspects of PhotoShop that you will every need.  However, \\"Photoshop for Nature Photographers : A Workshop in a Book\\" does a great job of specilizing for nature photographers.  As with any workshop, it does require the student to do some work to get the most out of the class. <br /> <br />I recommend this book to any nature photographer who would like to improve their utilization and knowledge of PhotoShop. <br />
N I love Aristotle and this is a good collection, but my book fell apart!  I had a course that used just this book, and despite the fact that we all took good care of our copies, nearly all of our books tore in half or lost pages.  Some actually had to make a new book out of it!
N To his discredit, Dr. Unwin virtually brags in the introductory chapter that nearly all of the questions and arguments that have mystified pterosaurs since their discovery have been answered in recent years,  but when it comes time to reveal those answers, Unwin typically sidesteps. Origins? Still not sure. Family tree? With over a hundred genera to choose from,  and many recently discovered, Unwin falls back on a favorite few and places them on an antique tree, not a modern cladogram. While Unwin's writing style is refreshing and easy to read (every chapter opens with short fiction), and his photos are first rate, the line work is rarely original and never detailed. Almost nothing is shown from the neck down. Only skulls are presented. Most, if not all, of the drawings  are recognizable from other sources. So, a disappointed reader here.
N Hands down, the funniest book I've ever read.  It's touching, frustrating, and poignant.  I even related to this character, and I'm a 35 year-old woman.    <br /> <br />Read it, you won't regret it! <br /> <br />
N I read this book over a couple of days.  It was hard to put down.  The things I liked best about this book were very interesting characters that made you think hard about them, a plot filled with suspense to the end, multiple subplots that merged well together, and a lean writing style that let me focus mostly on the characters and the provocative web I found them in.  This is a very thougthfully crafted story. I think most anyone would enjoy this novel.  Highly recommended.
N During the reign of Henry VIII, at fourteen Elizabeth Meredith inherited Friarsgate when her mother and older middle sister married and moved onto their respective spouses' estate and her oldest sibling and her husband chose the king's court.  Eight years later she remains independent running her estate until her mother informs her she must marry so that an heir can inherit Friarsgate.<br /><br />Her beloved sixty years old Uncle Thomas agrees to escort the feisty landowner to court.  However, before they leave for London, Baen MacColl comes from Scotland at the behest of his father to discus a sheep deal.  As the two die in the wool anti-marital soul mates fall in love, Elizabeth chaperoned by her uncle travels to the king's court.  There she befriends the beleaguered queen while Henry VIII begins his campaign to replace his wife Katherine with Anne.<br /><br />The key to this battle between two independent obstinate loving combatants is the background that incorporates Henry's antics as he sets in motion his plan to remove Katherine of Aragon as queen and replace her with Anne Boleyn.  Bertrice Small cleverly uses the monumental sixteenth century events to tell her story of love yet in some ways the shadow overwhelms the lead characters.  Fans of historical romance with strong doses of both will enjoy the latest Meredith tale (see UNTIL YOU AND PHILIPPA).<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
N Due to deregulation, a national company holding a monopoly in the transportation industry requested my consulting services to prepare for this upcoming change. Using Dr. Cohen's book as my reference and bench-mark, I could easily follow and prepare a solid consulting proposal, and when accepted, to work it out and present it successfully. I strongly recommend this book to consulting novices and veterans alike.
N This book isn't merely a primer for capitalist thinking, it is a Bible for free enterprise.  Everyone on the planet should read MILLIONAIRE REPUBLICAN, then utilize the implements provided.  The result would be a peaceful, hard-working universe. <br /> <br />I look forward to the day Mr. Root becomes a novelist and weaves his philosophy through the prism of fiction.  MOVE OVER, AYN RAND.
N The Outlander series are my favorite books of all time, period.  But after reading the Fiery Cross, I was a bit let down, as many people were, and afraid that the rest of the series would just continue to go downhill.  So when A Breath of Snow and Ashes came out, I was so glad to see that it was getting good reviews.  I finally got to read it this week and was not disappointed in the least. <br />All the characters we know and love are back, and Brianna seems to have finally grow up.  She has been my least favorite character since the second book, but this time around she was actually likeable (for the most part).  At certain points this book became so intense that I actually had to put it down and take a break for awhile, but not all readers will have this experience, only ones that are practically obsessed with this series (and who's friends have to remind them, \\"Jamie is NOT a real person!).    <br />So basically, if you have read the previous books, just read this one. Please.  You won't regret it.  The only reason I didn't give this one five stars is that I think nothing can top Outlander and Dragonfly in Amber.  If I could give this 4.5, I would. <br /> <br />One thing I have wondered about - if Claire dies back in the 1700's, then she'll be born again in 1918, go back in time in 1946, die in the 1700's, be born in 1918, and just keep repeating this forever.  For all she knows this could be her tenth time doing this.  I haven't seen this matter dealt with in the books.  Did I just miss it or something?
N It must be difficult-given the plethora of books on Lincoln-to shed new light on an old subject.  However, Elizabeth Brownstein does. Through careful and thorough research, Ms. Brownstein addresses issues hitherto unexplored. Lincoln's summer home...provides a suitable setting to describe Lincoln's activities outside the White House.  One learns, for instance, that the first draft of the Emancipation Proclamation was completed here. One also learns that, far from being a retreat from the hustle and bustle of Pennsylvania Avenue, the home facilitated Lincoln's open-mindedness about receiving virtual strangers at virtually any hour of the day or night and resulted in serious sleep deprivation.  <br /> <br />However, it was in the other topics addressed in the book that Lincoln's character is at its most illuminating. His fascination with weaponry, his patience in his dealings with his wife, and his ability to establish collegial relationship with people of vastly differing temperaments are all thoughtfully explored...The characters highlighted are dispassionately analyzed in such a way as to enable the reader to be part of the scene at all times.  For instance, Lincoln's wife, so often pilloried...is given a fair hearing and is properly depicted as a courageous soul confronted by agonizing choices and exaggerated expectations of the First Lady's performance as a suitable consort of the most admired President in American History...Mrs. Brownstein provides a valuable service for readers interested in the less dramatic, but no less insightful, clues about Lincoln the President, confronted, as he was, by the unprecedented challenges associated with his era. <br />
N This book was right on and what i had been looking for to help me understand the men in my life whether the men i date or family memembers. My guy is a \\"Fence Sitter\\", i always new it wasn't me. He's exactly what it says in the book. Thanks to the authors i will use their book as a guide to men. I hope they write more books like this.
N I enjoyed reading Eragon. Now I am reading it to my 3 boys. I was constantly amazed that it was written by someone who was so young. I was captivated by each page and I could not wait to find out what happened next.  My boys love sword fighting, dragons, magic and heros and they love Eragon.  We are looking forward to the next book.<br /><br />  Larna
N I was spellbound from the first page; Maggie Shayne has proven her talent again in this novel. I love the vampire stories and hope Maggie will keep on writing them.
N \\"Informative and entertaining.\\" --\\"Home\\" <br /> <br />\\"It inspires.  As you turn the pages, you can see that nothing is impossible.\\" <br />--\\"House Beautiful\\"
N I swear, you've never seen so much manuevering in your life. Page after page, Estrich covers Hillary's butt in increasingly implausible ways. It all gets to a point where one only laughs at the lengths to which some people will go to elect this woman. The Case FOR Hillary Clinton? There isn't one.
N Genuinely witty and fun.  I really liked the incorporation of the cartoon and quotations into the book, this made it more interesting and gave a better perspective on the chapters.  An uplifting read from beginning to end.
N For me, Wolfe's detailing of both the academic and social spheres at Dupont rang true.  As a student at a university driven by both scholarly research and the party scene, I can picture many of the novel's more dramatic scenes.  Some, like the Saint Ray party toward the beginning or the intimidating neuroscience lecture hall, I felt as if i were remembering rather than reading.   <br /> <br />No, there is no university quite like Dupont, succeeding in academics and sports at the highest levels.  If he had not given the school these characteristics, however, Wolfe might have put himself at a disadvantage:  There would be less of a chance for a reader to identify with the university, the characters, the scenes, and his commentary would have been limited to fewer aspects of today's campuses.  A novel about an UNDERachieving university might be interesting as well, but I think the scope of I Am Charlotte Simmons, and Dupont in particular, was well suited to Wolfe's acute powers of observation.
N \\"The Face\\", the first book in this volume, is probably the best of the five Demon Princes novels.  The reasons are manifest.  Villainous Lens Larque provides some of the best challenges and intimidation for our hero, Kirth Gersen.  There's the usual helping of exquisite writing and fine descriptions; the menu items during Gersen's restraunt visits are particularly noteworthy.  Most importantly, \\"The Face\\" is the most morally challenging novel in the series.  It presents, to some extent, the best argument for Gersen abandoning his single-minded hunt for revenge in his abortive attempts at romance with two characters.  Lastly, \\"The Face\\" has a killer ending, laugh-out-loud serious if there ever was such a thing. <br /> <br />Another notable element is the planet Dar Sai and its inhabitants, the Darsh.  Dar Sai is odd even by Vance standards.  Giant umbrellas of water protect folks from searing daytime heat, the women grow mustaches, food is prized for its repulsiveness and gender wars are taken to a whole new level.  Vance scores particular points by showing us the spoiled tourists who visit solely to mock the backwards Darsh.  An just dessert is served for them at the end, of course. <br /> <br />The last novel in the series, \\"The Book of Dreams\\", is competent but less biting than \\"The Face\\".  The new villain, Howard Alan Treesong, is less impressively hateable than Lens Larque or Viole Falshune from \\"The Palace of Love\\".  \\"The Book of Dreams\\" contains vignettes set on numerous planets, none of them particuarly brilliant.  The best parts of this novel are the introductory segments to each chapter.  Short paragraphs cover a wide range of ground, from the hilarious philosophical basis of the Institute to the stunning character introductions for Treesong's various Paladins.
N This is a marvelous and beautifully realized work of fiction. As someone who enjoys mysteries, as well as historical fiction and gothic novels of suspense, I was quite taken with this book. Intricately plotted, the book is clever in its premise. Two disparate human beings, a highly independent, red-headed slip of a woman, Samantha Flood, Australian by birth, and a serious, fervently religious Spaniard, Miguel Madero, who is half-English, find themselves thrust together, as each explores the tiny, remote Cumbrian village of Illthwaite in England, looking for answers to their individual quests.  Both are in Illthwaite to get information relative to that which each is seeking. Both are staying in the local inn, called The Stranger House.<br /><br />Samantha is a brilliant but brash mathematician in her early twenties. Fondly known as Sam to her friends, she is interested in tracing her familial roots. She has recently discovered that her paternal grandmother was from this part of the world,  having been a part of a huge number of children migrants that had been unceremoniously shipped from England to other parts of its Empire, including Australia. Samantha is interested in finding out more about her paternal grandmother and the mystery surrounding her.<br /><br />Miguel, or Mig, as he is known to his family and friends, is the scion of a well-known house of vintners in Spain and is in his late twenties. He is a former seminarian who has suffered from manifestations of what he believes to be stigmata. He also, on occasion, sees ghostly manifestations or visions. Recovering from a serious alpine accident that nearly killed him, he is now in Illthwaite ostensibly to do research  for his thesis on the experience of English Catholics during the Reformation. He is, however, actually in Illthwaite to find out more about an ancestor of his who mysteriously disappeared there centuries ago during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I.<br /><br />In Illthwaite, Both Sam and Mig find themselves up against obstacles placed in their way. It seems that its residents are not totally forthcoming or are reluctant to part with information relative to their respective quests. What they each individually discover is that things are not always as they seem in Illthwaite.  Moreover, their divergent interests are more intertwined than they could ever have imagined. They will discover that they have more in common than they realized, having come full circle in a cosmic design not of their making.<br /><br />This book has well-drawn characters that come alive under the author's expert hand. The plot is unusual, as well as complex, containing many layers that the discerning reader will enjoy exploring. Well-written, as well as intricately plotted, this book crosses a number of genres. With its supernatural portents, historical underpinnings, underlying mystery, as well as its gothic type  suspense and sensibilities, infused with just a dollop of  romance, this book will appeal to those readers who favor these genres. In particular, I found the parts of the book that transcended into historical fiction to be the most compelling. This is not a book for everyone, but to  those for whom its themes have inherent appeal, it is a book to be relished.mselves up against obstacles placed in their way.

Y This is a marvelous read, and those already familiar with the Abel Jones series will not be disappointed.  Again, I am amazed and appreciative of the amount of research that Mr. Parry puts into his novels, and this book is a prime example.  It is a wonderful story that not only entertains, but also enlightens about one of the most important eras in our history, and, one of the most important cities and cultures (New Orleans) in our country.  I couldn't put it down and read it all in one sitting.  Thank again to the author, and I look forward to reading about how the venerable Abel Jones will come to grips with his latest personal struggle regarding family over duty!
N This is a very important book.  We need to change the current tax system and this book will answer all your questions.
N Island a Memoir by Elaine Pace is written from the heart.  A wonderful sharing of a personal journey to a different way of life, in a different place, celebrating different activities. <br />   The descriptions of the Vineyard takes the reader to a special place deep in their memory, yet it is a warm and delightful experience.
N Mark and Alissa's Creative Tax Planner takes the fear out of finances for the creative person. Before I used their book I was a just an amature photographer, but I now I am a confident professional because I know how to handle my money. There is a slot for every type of artistic or business expense so I know what I need to hang on to for tax time.  <br />This book can makes me money and gives me the peace of mind to be able to run a photography business and know that I won't have a big nasty surprise come April 15th.
N The premise of the book is hilarious: Dick and Jane, all grown up and still living in suburbia. But this isn't the suburbia of Ward and June Cleaver. It's the suburbia of \\"Desperate Housewives\\" with a Yiddish twist.<br /><br />It made me nostalgic for my years living in Miami Beach. Oy ve, where did the years go? Even the goyim who didn't grow up hearing Yiddish will love this book.
N If you were stunned by \\"Gridlinked,\\" and left awe-struck by \\"The Line of Polity,\\" then I guarantee you won't be disappointed with \\"Brass Man.\\" Picking up almost immediately after the end of Line, it continues the saga of ECS agent Ian Cormac, and weaves narratives for many characters introduced in the previous two novels - plus several fascinating new ones - into an extremely satisfying whole. Best of all, it brings back one of the most unique and enigmatic of all of Asher's creations - the flawed yet noble Golem Twenty-Five, Mr. Crane.
N This is one of my all time favorite books I could not put it down, the story is Amazing it keeps you wondering till the end, you can't help but feel the pain and views of all the characters even Delia's dad Andrew.
N This attractively illustrated book provides a showcase of Israel's achievements in fields as diverse as agriculture, education, medicine, science and technology. It looks at the technologies, processes and the products from this tiny little land that are improving the lives of so many people. The authors highlight some of the people responsible for this ingenuity that is benefiting the whole world.<br /><br />For example, at the Weizmann Institute, Dr Michal Schwartz has developed a way of harnessing immune system cells to repair and revive damaged nerve fibres. Other medical breakthroughs include the miniscule camera-in-a-tablet used for internal diagnosis, ultrasound for destroying tumours and Israel's highly effective disaster relief operations.<br /><br />A great help to third world people has been the discovery by scientist Yoel Margalith of the Bti bacterium that kills certain kinds of flies and harmful mosquitoes.  This has already saved millions of livers and is an environment-friendly intervention. Most remarkable is that Margalith is a holocaust survivor, of both the Bergen-Belsen and Teresienstadt camps.<br /><br />In many fields Israel is so far ahead of the pack that other countries have no chance of catching up. One of the most interesting innovations developed in Israel is a project to avoid collisions between aircraft and migratory birds. It involved the study of the flight paths of birds. This work of researcher Yossi Leshem is now also used by the Jordanian and Turkish air-force.<br /><br />Israel has more engineers per capita than any other country on earth and a remarkable number of hi-tech companies. Innovation in the fields of computers and information technology is particularly impressive. This encompasses software, operating systems, storage & retrieval systems, verification and firewall technologies, plus a host of mobile phone applications.<br /><br />Israel's creativity is not restricted to science and technology, as there is also much happening in arts and culture. Despite its small size and its many enemies, this country is bursting with creative energy and making a huge contribution to the global marketplace and to quality of life worldwide.<br /><br />The founders of this brave country were aware that Israel had almost no natural resources and that its people therefore had to develop and apply their brainpower. Well, they are succeeding spectacularly. What a pity that Israel has to devote so much of its money and resources to protect itself from its neighbours! If its full genius were given free reign, it would become even more of a blessing to the world.ts small size and its many enemies, this country is bursting with creative energy and making a huge contribution to the global marketplace and to quality of life worldwide.

N I just want to say, that for a used book, this book arrived in great condition.  I think that it even came in shrink wrap!  I'm pleased with my purchase and am glad that I don't have to read through other people's notes and marks as I study for my class.  Good job!
N \\"Last Chance to See\\" is Douglas Adams' hilarious and though-provoking non-fiction, eco-travel narrative about circling the globe in search of some of the Earth's most endangered animals. We get to see a side of Adams that is deeply concerned with the plight of the beautiful, unique, and often ludicrously implausible lifeforms on our planet -- the same side that prompted him to climb Mount Kilimanjaro in a rhino suit.     What made this book all the more meaningful to me was that I'd thought I'd finished all of Douglas Adams' books long ago. I loved them all, but I never fully appreciated the depth of his genius as a humanist and social satirist until, sadly, he had passed away.  What's more, I never realized how much Adams' writings meant to me until I was hit with the cold, hard reality that he'd written all he ever would.  Douglas Adams had hitched his last ride across the galaxy, and I'd never hear from him again.  Or so I thought.    Infinitely improbable as it may seem, I heard from Douglas Adams again about two weeks ago.  I was browsing around in Borders, long since resigned to the fact that I'd read the last \\"new\\" Douglas Adams book I ever would, when I stumbled upon \\"Last Chance to See.\\" I felt like I'd gone into the pet store to buy a parakeet and, instead, found a dodo bird.      The endangered species Douglas Adams criss-crossed the globe in search of are all, in their own ways, remarkable and priceless. He urges us not to wait until they're gone to fully appreciate them, and he drives this point home to today's readers, in his own ironic style, by now being himself \\"extinct.\\"    If you're a Douglas Adams fan, and you've never read this book, here it is -- your own \\"last chance to see\\" (or, rather, read) him.  His own voice, his own words, his own experiences.  For me, it was a fond farewell from an old friend I'd never met, who, from his new home -- far beyond life, the universe, and everything -- telling me, \\"Yes, I'm dead. But there are still a few rhinos and gorillas and dolphins that aren't. Do me a favor; make sure they stay that way.\\"
N I really enjoyed the humor and visual scenes about Botswana in this book.
N ALthough he is correct that the IMF and World Bank can and should play a role, he should also advocate reforming these institutions so that they not only reflect the interest of the dominant capitalist countries. Politics has a role as well, and he must address the inherent contradictions within the Capitalist system that encourages capital accumulation, flight and waste. All in all and interesting read from an \\"insider\\"...if you are looking for alternatives to the \\"Washington Consensus\\" then this is not your book. This book mainly advocates tweeking the international system (IMF, World bank, UN) to help alleviate poverty (which has political as well as economic reasons) but not changing it per se. I would have hoped that he would have taken on more the Capitalist world system and its predictable modern expression of it and its future trajectory.
N The issue with opinion like his is that atheism is easy. IN complete arrogance any 8th grader can clearly refute the possibilites of the scriptures using 8th grade science! <br /> <br />What Earl misses is the basis for all believers.  <br /> <br />                      \\"Faith\\" <br /> <br />Scientists have no faith seeking earthy proof. The ultimate arrogance is the man who can refute the smallest evidance of something he does not understand. Something that requires \\"faith\\" above all.  <br /> <br />Without faith this book is just as moot as the book by Sobel. Without faith. Neither is relavant. <br /> <br />Tom B
N If you like the story that has been happening up until now, you will like this book. <br /> <br />If you want to give this series a shot, go for it.  It is the best story around.  It is a little lengthy and detailed, but that does not make it bad, just precise. <br /> <br />Look at the haters to see what type of people don't like this book or series.  Most haven't read this book or some of the others.  People should not be bitter at the author for doing what he wants to do.  If someone doesn't like it they should go red something else instead of crying about it.
N I picked this book up as it was the same edition that the local Vo-tech uses to teach their courses.  The amazon price was the least expensive.  The book is complete and comes with self evaluation software to see if one is ready for the A+ exam.  It is no substitute for actually training but I think a self motivated \\"techy\\" might be able to pass the A+ with this book alone.
N In a not too distant future, Angel is a certified Retribution Specialist (CRS), which means that when the law fails to bring justice, the victims can hire a CRS to bring in the perpetrator of the crime to them to enact their own justice.  When a closed case is reopened, Angel is again under investigation for \\"what happened\\" the night policeman Danny Black died.  On top of dealing with this, her mother, Lola, gets kidnapped, and Angel knows that if she doesn't rescue Lola herself, she might die. <br /> <br />Because she has Detective Marco following her and questioning her movements - from the past as well as during the events he witnesses personally, she starts finding things out about herself she really didn't want to know...like her exceptionally good luck.  It may not be luck after all; the physic abilities Lola has may actually be genuine and she inherited them.  <br /> <br />KISS OF THE BLUE DRAGON is the second story I've read by Julie Beard, and I actually like her writing style better here.  The story is written in first person, which can drive readers batty (me too upon occasion); however, it works here.  There is a different \\"feel\\" to KISS completely.  For me, I can \\"hear\\" a narrator filling in the details of Angels' activities.  So even though we, as a reader, only get to know her thoughts and impressions of what she sees, we still get to know what is going on around her.  You get to know Angel, what motivates her and see how she thinks very well.  I also really liked the fact that a lot of simple details of her life are included. <br />  <br />I will admit it was a close call as to whether I would like Angel or not.  She almost doesn't seem feminine.  However, if you read a little further into the book, you learn what her logic is, how she thinks but more importantly WHY.  Angel is tough, spunky, kick-butt heroine and out to help those unable to help themselves.  She is fearless and makes her decisions based on what is right rather than whether she willget hurt or not.  Angel is one busy lady.  She has cases that she maintains during the process of rescuing Lola and I liked the fact that Julie Beard didn't drop some of these issues, therefore the story stays three dimensional.   <br /> <br />While the reopened investigation is secondary to what is going on in her life, it is what brings our hero and heroine together.  I was happy with the chemistry between her and Detective Marco even if the bedroom scenes take place off of the books pages.   <br /> <br />I like the fact that even though KISS is a science-fiction romance, the author doesn't go out of her way to create objects that will stump the reader, or throw off the flow of the novel.  For an example: in a time where DNA left behind is what would keep you in jail, rather than using a hollow-tip bullet, a criminal would use a bullet filled with acid therefore destroying the evidence.   <br /> <br />KISS is technically supposed to be a romance, but with the way this story ends, we don't have our heroine hooking up with the hero.  Because Lola was kidnapped by one of the Chicago mobs there are still some unresolved issues that its sequel might wrap up.  Regardless, I didn't feel like major details were left out or the story wasn't well developed.  As a reader I didn't find myself wondering, \\"what just happened\\"?   <br /> <br />I found KISS OF THE BLUE DRAGON very interesting, and look forward to reading the further adventures of Angel in its sequel TOUCH OF THE WHITE TIGER.  So, if you are looking for something a little different, check out this story!
Y National Geographic Traveler is the best series of its type, and the NGT Thailand book has the same standards of quality as all the others.  It provides an excellent mix of written descriptions and beautiful pictures, both of which are helpful in determining whether to include places on your trip itinerary.  The only flaw is that the hotel and meal section is not particularly useful.
N My assumption is that a DK Eyewitness Book entitled \\"Aztec, Inca & Maya\\" would devote sections to each of the three great civilizations that Spanish explorers encountered and eradicated in the 16th century.  The Aztec empire stretched between the Pacific and the Atlantic costs of Mesoamerica, the Maya kingdom was found in the eastern part of Mesoamerica, and the Inca Empire stretched 4,000 miles along the western coast of South America.  But this book considers the people of these regions to be a mosaic of tribes and nations so that most of the chapters are topical, talking about food and drink, religious life, masks, and such in terms of all of the cultures that apply.  There are a few specific chapters devoted to the Incas and their ancestors and Cities of the Andes, but most toss in everything together.<br /><br />I have to admit, I do not find this approach to work anymore than one about Mediterranean cultures that lumps Spain, Italy and Greece together with the likes of Portugal, Sicily, and Crete thrown in for good measure.  In this volume the Olmecs, Teotihuacans, and Toltecs are thrown in for good measure, but not so that you can have anything close to a clear conception of the specific cultures.  There are some topics where it makes sense to talk about multiple cultures, such as the Human sacrifice by the Incas and Aztecs, but that does not apply to all of these topics.  Consequently, I am tempted to get different colored highlighters and color code the three main cultures throughout the book so it is easier to make the connections.<br /><br />As always, the chief attraction of this Eyewitness Book is that it is filled with photographs of artifacts from museums around the world, from the Archaeological Museum in Lima the National Palace in Mexico City to the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale in Florence and the Rietberg Museum in Zurich (a subtle reminder that a lot of New World treasures made their way to Europe).  Most of us will never get to see a Toltec coyote warrior inlaid with mother-of-pearl, the Gateway of the Sun at Tiahuanaco, or a \\"teponaztli\\" (horizontal drum) in person.  \\"The Los Angeles Times Book Review\\" called one of these volumes \\"Like a mini-museum between the covers of a book,\\" which is so on point that DK always puts that quote on the back.  Almost as important, Elizabeth Bauedano provides detailed captions for the illustrations so that you know what you are looking at and what it means.  Consequently \\"Aztec, Inca & Maya\\" works better as a supplemental source than as an introduction to these fascinating civilizations.nlaid with mother-of-pearl, the Gateway of the Sun at Tiahuanaco, or a \\"teponaztli\\" (horizontal drum) in person.  \\"The Los Angeles Times Book Review\\" called one of these volumes \\"Like a mini-museum between the covers of a book,\\" which is so on point that DK always puts that quote on the back.

N Isabella Zophie & Le Cirque de Magique is an excellent book. I would say that it is one of the best books that I have ever read. It is very exciting and I enjoyed the mystery that was in the story. This is one of the most adventurous books that I have ever read.  <br /> <br />This book is about a ten year old girl, Isabella Zophie, who finds the Locket of Fire and Water in her great aunt's house and when she puts it on she is transported to another world - Zartarbia. She meets a circus which has lots of great characters including Mr Krock O'Dile who is a crocodile that runs the circus.  Isabella is chased by one of the syndicate, Mistress Sectica.  The Syndicate are a group of villains who are trying to control Zartarbia.  Fighting against the syndicate is the Federation Against Dark Forces (FADF) with agents trained in some of the coolest fighting techniques.   <br /> <br />Zartarbia is a magical world where nothing is as it seems. There is a crazy character called the Thinker who is a complete lunatic and very funny.  The first chapter is a bit confusing but you need to keep reading as it is important for later in the book.  <br /> <br />I think that all genders will like this book. Some parts in this book are very funny. If you are interested in fantasy and adventure, then you will enjoy this book.  <br /> <br />I would recommend this book to anyone.  <br />
N All of these books rock!!!  I love them soooo much, I really wish a number seven would come out!!!!
N Being new to Sharepoint and webparts, I found this book to be concise and to-the-point. Guides you through basic webpart development in C# (when you register the book you can get code in VB if you desire). The book also discusses in straightforward terms debugging, deployment of webparts, code access security, targeting audiences and personalizing content. Plus it is only 175 pages, so it won't collapse your bookshelf.
N First,  the author is not a \\"cad\\".  He is too ugly and broke to be able to seduce women and leave them feeling used.  I got this book from the library because as a single gal I thought that I would learn something about men,  the kind who charm,  seduce,  and destroy.  Well,  what I learned is that Rick Marin is just a talentless guy trying to pass himself off as an intropesctive writer-wannabe poser.  It's amazing that Marin got any girls to date him taking into consideration how cold and judgmental he is. Reading his book was like watching a car accident--you know it's better to control yourself but you keeping looking to see the blood and guts.  Well,  this book just shows that this guy,  who has really nothing special,  or even redeemable,  is striving to be funny, intellectual, and show the male perspective on dating. He comes off really shallow,  superficial,  and as though he doesn't care which girl he's with as long as he's not alone.  Read it for yourself--Marin has nothing new or interesting to write. In this day and age,  anyone can publish regardless of whether or not the writer has anything significant to write about.
N Simple and easy to understand. I wish the book would have gone into a little more detail but I found that detail in the HR 25 website. <br />Boortz and Linder did a good job laying out the positive and the negatives in this book. I will not diatribe about my personal politics has you have probably noticed with most of these posts. Read the book and make up your own mind. Write your newspaper with your political thoughts and write your review of the BOOK here. <br />
N In Goodbye Doesn't Mean Forever, Lurlene McDaniel tells a heart-felt story of a teenage girl who is struggling with cancer. <br /> Melissa finds out early in the story that her leukemia, which has been in remission for two years has relapsed. Jory, Melissa's best friend promises to help her have the best senior year ever, because of all the stress and pain in Melissa's life. Melissa's older brother, Michael, who is also Jory's life long crush, is asked to donate bone marrow to Melissa, because that is her only hope. Soon after, Melissa becomes well and in a couple of days, the doctors say she will be able to go home. Jory goes to visit her two days later, only to find that Melissa has caught a fever and that her body is rejecting the bone marrow. At school, a boy named Lyle tries to help Jory with all the sorrow of her sick friend. Eventually, Jory falls in love with Lyle, but still has feelings for Michael. Will Jory find true love? Will Melissa overcome cancer? To find out, read Goodbye Doesn't Mean Forever. <br /> I highly recommend this book to any girl ages 12-112 that enjoys romance and drama novels. It is an amazing book and I promise that if you read it, you won't be disappointed.  <br /> <br />
N Grant and Twain is a good book, informative, insightful, and concise enough.  <br /> <br />Mark Perry starts by giving us very good sketches of the lives of the two principals up to the point of the story, including some surprising (for me) details about their personal lives.  He then goes into their relationship, how it came to be, and the affect it had on their great works of literature. The books influenced by their time together, Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and Grant's Personal Memoirs, are considered to be classics and the best that either of the authors ever produced.  In fact, some think that Huckleberry Finn is the best American novel ever, and that Personal Memoirs (about the Mexican and Civil Wars) is the best American book ever written on military events.   Perry records many conversations Grant and Twain had with each other and with the other folks surrounding them, including families and associates.  It makes you feel like you are there, and gives some personal insight into what these gentlemen were really like. We find that they were both quite remarkable as private figures as well as public figures. The story of their relationship rides to a great extent on the heroic drama of Grant racing to finish his book before dying of cancer, to ensure the financial security of his family.  Perry, at the same time, paints a fascinating sketch of what Twain called the Gilded Age, a time of great industrial progress along with great corruption in the U.S. <br /> <br />It was a thoroughly enjoyable read. <br />
N \\"Truth vs Falsehood\\" is Hawkins' 4th book. In my mind, it is his greatest gift yet, but not in the sense that one might think. This will be explained in the closing. I will also preface by saying that I am in no way political. Truth is all that I am interested in. <br />   In Hawkins' previous 3 books, the kinesiological response was portrayed as infallible. His language was very absolute in its tone, giving the technique more credibility than it has ever received. Being so absolute with one's tone was the first obvious clue. When one becomes absolute in their tone, they often put an inordinate amount of faith in something outside themselves and overlook the inherent limitations. This is true for everything from religious absolutism to the mythical cure-all in medicine. The person who uses the absolute tone acts as if your salvation lies with this one particular thing.  <br />   I am a traditional naturopath. I was using kinesiology before Hawkins' books, and I am closely connected to practitioners of kinesiology who've used it in excess of 20 years. An observant and curious practitioner quickly realizes that the intent of both the testee and tester influences response. In some cases, a strong-willed practitioner who thinks he knows the cause of imbalance or dis-ease is affecting testee response and in essence using kinesiology to validate his own opinions and beliefs, albeit unknowingly. He will get the positive response he desires, whereas the practitioner with no vested interest in anything except the truth will get a different response on the same testee.  <br />   It has been difficult for me to bridge the gap between Hawkins' theory/ doctoral thesis on his use of kinesiology and the understanding that most experienced practitioners of kinesiology have. Nearly all experienced practitioners simply don't find the technique to be infallible. Certain criteria must be met for accurate response. Those criteria are training, impartiality, and the sincere and humble desire to put absolute truth above all things. Truth is absolute, but the technique is not. Remaining neutral is an ongoing challenge for the practitioner. <br /> <br />   I am not familiar with the testing methods used for Hawkins' doctoral thesis \\"Quantitative and Qualitative Calibration of the Levels of Consciousness\\". However, for it to withstand any scientific scrutiny, both the tester and testee would have to be without any knowledge on the subject matter. There would also have to be at least 20 different testers for the 3000+ test subjects, with each tester coming up with their own test responses to a given list of questions. Responses would not be compared until all testers have compiled their findings. For his thesis, something along these lines was most likely used.  <br />   Throughout \\"Power vs. Force\\", a healthy skepticism was maintained towards Hawkins putting so much faith in this technique. Part of this was based on an inability to get the same responses he was getting. The information presented in \\"The Eye of the I\\" and \\"I\\" was absolutely astounding, and skepticism was temporarily set aside. Apparently, his intent was pure and sincere enough to allow him to experience absolute truth on spiritual inquiry. Much of this can be attributed to his description of a life-changing experience. He was atheist (or possibly agnostic... don't remember which), hit a major crisis in his life, and finally called out in total humility to be shown the truth of God. I feel his pure intent allowed him to access the truth he did. <br />   However, once Hawkins gained confidence in the technique, he apparently fell into the trap of thinking he could divorce himself from influencing response. The methods used for gleaning the information found in \\"Truth vs Falsehood\\" would surely not withstand any scientific scrutiny. The simple fact that the subject matter was familiar to the tester(s) and testee(s) disqualifies it. Asking about the nature of life, death, and other unknown spiritual matters is not the same as asking about one's perceived reality, which one already has strong opinions and emotions about and attachments to. Both testers and testees would have to be completely unfamiliar with the line of inquiry to have any guarantee of neutrality. <br /> <br />   Within 30 seconds of opening \\"Truth vs Falsehood\\", it was clear something wasn't right. Hawkins' 3 previous books have helped us to discern truth from falsehood more clearly. Many of us have reached a place where now we `just know' the truth. It is often a clear gut feeling, and at that point the kinesiological response seems unnecessary. In a way, it turns out the technique was only a tool to guide us to our own inner knowing.  <br />   Hawkins acknowledges the existence of ignorance and untruth, but does not address the issue of deliberate deception. It is ironic that after years of devotion to the truth, Hawkins still does not fully grasp the nature of deception. The world citizenry is currently experiencing one of the most elaborate mass brainwashes in history.  <br />   In fact, Hawkins even engages in deception when he explains the Iraq situation. He indicates that the primary reason to be there is to protect the world's (and specifically America's) economic and oil interests. Yet the primary reason given to the public for going to war was weapons of mass destruction. Whether or not it was a fact that there were actually WMDs misses the point. It was given as the main reason, and it was not. That is deception. For Hawkins to agree with the idea of justifiable deceptions is a clear indicator that he is not neutral here. <br />   More importantly, for Hawkins to act as if outright deception is not occurring speaks to one's ability to deal with reality. For a person with 80 years of conditioned perception of reality to have reality turned on its head, a person could have a serious breakdown. <br /> <br />   The gift in this 4th book is that Hawkins has shown us what thekinesiological technique can and cannot be used for. It can be used by the sincere truthseeker for his/herself. However, it is not to be used to show one a reality they are not ready to see. There is no technique to make one see the truth. One's clear and sincere intention is all that can do that. And even then, one may not be ready to handle the fullness of reality. The process of how one \\"wakes up\\" is yet to be known. <br />   Who better than Hawkins to show us that experience is no substitute for impartiality? So, the readers of his 4th book get the opportunity to discern what is truth and what is his belief. The first 3 books prepared us, and the 4th is the test. Although he didn't intend it to work this way, it is the greatest gift of all. And just as importantly, it shows us that one can be quite enlightened in one area, while not having it all together in another. Even when one crosses the 600 line, one is still assailed by falsity and ignorance and must be constantly vigilant and unattached to one's beliefs.  <br /> <br />   And realistically, it couldn't have happened any other way. Given Hawkins' first 3 books and his audience, if he gave us the absolute truth about all the deceptions that make up the current perceived reality, it could have seriously messed some people up. It could result in serious mental breakdown if it was said that there aren't actually arab terrorists creating terror in America. So, the book had to be presented this way. And those of us who know the real truth know it through our own inner knowing already and don't need Hawkins to tell us. <br />   In `The Art of War', Sun Tzu said, \\"All warfare is based on deception.\\" Well, currently we have warfare in nearly every form. Even `necessary' and `justified' wars have deception as their roots. <br /> <br />Michael <br />Santa Fe, New Mexico
N In Three Creeks, Manitoba Emily Moore is worried about her septuagenarian neighbor and friend Daniel Rutherford, who she has not heard from in a week and who missed a wedding in which the entire town showed up.  She visits his property to learn he has been gone for about a week.  Inside his dying plants show he has not been there.<br /><br />Worse a stranger is residing in Daniel's house insisting that he is a nephew interested in his family tree.  However, as the residences on Creek Road suffer a rash of odd break-ins, Emily notices that Matthew is paying more attention to her and her parents than the Rutherford family.  Emily wonders is he really a relative of her neighbor or is he the B&E bandit?  Regardless, she knows from the moment their eyes saw one another, something inside her heart clicked.<br /><br />The sequel to THE HOUSE ON CREEK ROAD is a fine romantic suspense thriller as Emily wonders whether her heart has betrayed her since the stranger seems to be \\"investigating\\" her family not his as he claims.  Matthew finds the conflict of interest even more difficult as he hides why he is in town from the woman he has fallen in love with though they hardly know one another.  The romance is perhaps too fast yet seems right as it adds conflict between the two wannabe lovers.  Fans will want to travel down THE WINTER ROAD.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
N Just want to clarify how to  use the Emanuel Contracts book:<br /><br />I recommend it as a semester-long guide. This will help you flesh out the varied topics and clarify them as you are reading your casebook. This book recommends reading your casebook first, then referring to the same topics in this volume to ensure you understand the material--this should be done before you encounter the material in class, preferably.<br /><br />If you're looking for something to pick up midway during the semester or just before finals, I think the Crunchtime series by the same publisher is a better choice.
N I enjoyed the comments of the preceding which told me much about the book in my conteplation of purchasing it. Lucent's down fall started with the 1984 decree. Something that AT&T embraced thinking that new and bigger markets would be available. Missteps included buying TCI cable without the experience and knowledge of running a mom and pop business on the run far from \\"Bell Standards\\" that so many Western Electric and Lucent Managers embraced. They did not change into the flexible and savy business men of the 80s and 90s and lost at every turn and decission. The \\"Early Outs\\" prior to 1991 took most of the business knowledge and stability with them. Managers and CEOs were hired from all differnt kinds of Companies having differnt values and business understandings (which was needed) but lacked fundamental telecommunications expertise and how to gain a lion's share of the market. The best method was new technologies coupled with listening to all the customers needs and concerns. Lucent, like its predecessor and parent company, devalued it's stock and undevalued it's once talented, dedicated and loyal workforce. The Book seems like a good purchase but it doesn't seem to touch upon the employees who built it and subsequently were forced to see it go. Bell Labs and the Bell System literally dictated to the Baby Bells that analog equipment would continue to be used in the late 70s. Digital technology had been introduced by various venders and Bell Labs played \\"catch up\\" when the operating companies began buying the digital equipment fron non Western Electric sources. That was the first mis-step of Western Electric....Lucent Technologies management. Understand the marketplace and the needs of your customer...always. R. Ferry...27 years with Western Electric.
Y It is to Jane Hyun's credit to discuss issues of Asian American professionals on a very practical level. There are however, some caveats for the reader. The book needs to be contextualized within a larger conceptual framework. The overarching issues are ignored within her practical framework, namely: Who needs to change? Who needs to accommodate whom?  How much? What are the risks and benefits? Her book appears to be saying that corporate America needs to understand Asians, but it does not need to change.  Rather it is the Asian professional that needs to change and adapt. <br /> <br />Is the book too heavily assimilationist?  It is not clear as Hyun does make a distinction early in her book between assimilation (\\"adopting ...at the expense of one's own cultural characteristics\\") and acculturation (\\"adapting ...while continuing to maintain values, perspectives, and features of one's native culture\\"). <br /> <br />There appears to be little adaptation of any Asian models or perspective to the mainstream USA corporate culture -- page 279 suggests two ways: \\"Develop cultural competency\\" and \\"Make use of your bicultural and bilingual abilities.\\" While recognizing the dominance of USA/Western research and models in the business world, it is also logical and no \\"one model fits all.\\" Perhaps future research and practices can provide indigenous Asian models or perspectives that can be adapted and work effectively in coporate America or other cultures.  The Special Issue on China & India (Business Week, August 22/29, 2005) points out how some USA business models are not applicable. <br /> <br />It is not an either/or proposition.  By utilizing the juxtaposition of the Asian behavior/values system versus the Western behavior/values system to present her central thesis, Hyun creates a false dichotomy in the mind of the reader. Current business literature is filled with exhortations of \\"win/win,\\" \\"both/and,\\" \\"alignment,\\" and \\"interdependence\\" -- all very Asian concepts. These traditional Asian cultural values are at the very heart of what contemporary corporate America is trying to effect in order to add value. So there is a \\"baby with the bath water\\" caveat here to the reader.  The accommodation needs to be reciprocal, not unilateral. <br /> <br />In her Epilogue, Hyun encourages the reader to \\"Develop an Action Plan That Works with Your Persona.\\"  It seems throughout her book that the emphasis is on asking the reader to tailor his or her persona to that which is required for success in corporate America, not on utilizing the behavioral strengths and cognitive positions with which someone who comes with a strong Asian cultural background is imbued.  Being Asian -- it seems to Hyun -- puts one in a deficit position. <br /> <br />The reader needs to be cautious in the self-assessment, individual profiles, exercises and tools cited. They yield helpful descriptive self-awareness profiles and information, not diagnostic or predictive profiles, and they are dependent on situational factors. There are many suggestions, based perhaps on many years of experience, but empirical data demonstrating their reliability, validity or efficacy are not mentioned. <br /> <br />Kudos to Hyun for encouraging the seeking of regular and frequent performance feedback. This is a career self-monitoring technique that is utilized far too little by all employees to help document and strengthen requests for job and salary advancement.  In spite of the conceptual conundrums, this highly practical book is a must read. <br /> <br />Adrian Chan (Kochman Mavrelis Associates, Oak Park, IL) & Barry Mar (Management & Resources Associates, Seattle, WA) <br />
N Dobson begins her easy-to-read book with chapters appropriately titled \\"Helping Your Child Love Learning\\" and \\"Creating Your Own Educational Reform\\". After reading just these two chapters I was already in love with the book.<br /><br />The remaining chapters consist of reader contributed ideas, lessons and games. These parents know how to make education so fun the kids probably won't even know they are learning! The ideas are easy, fast, inexpensive, and usually involve minimal research.<br /><br />What really makes this book stand far and above others is Table 2.2, found on pages 34-37. This helpful table lists many popular off-the-shelf curriculums that can be easily recreated at home with materials you already have, or can be found used - all for under $100!<br /><br />This book is truly ingenious! It's about time someone organized the ideas of creative parents into one handy reference. I cannot think of a better person to present this material other a personal favorite, Linda Dobson.
N This book is famous for its unique method. It attempts to establish what Hitler knew and when he knew it. In effect, it is written from Hitler's point of view. The events are narrated in the order Hitler experienced them, and as he experienced them. Thus one gets a vivid feeling of being present as history unfolds, an experience stolen by \\"omiscient\\" historians and biographers. Of course Irving also includes a huge amount of information gleaned from sometimes exclusive interviews with witnesses and participants. This book has been controversial since it first appeared in the 1970s. It has been publicly criticized by many historians. But it has also been tacitly praised by them, insoar as they have borrowed heavily from Irving's research.
N Beatifully written, moving and very original love story - with additional twists of philosophy and time traveling. For me, the most interesting part of the book was its alternative approach to time travel - something like living many lives simultaneosly, rather than traditional \\"what if\\" approach. Made me wonder - and think.
N I read this book mulitiple times. The way Card writes his characters as living breathing beings is wonderful. He doesn't just slap together a one dimensional character. The story moves rather slowly, but once you truly emerse yourself, it picks up. I was very shocked by the ending, but was overall pleased with the story and plotline. It isn't a happy story where everyone lives happily ever after, but then life isn't like that either.
N I started the series with Winter House and am now back tracking to the beginning.  I enjoyed this book as much as Winter House and can't wait to start the next one in the series.
N I've read almost every book written on the Beatles and found Cynthia's story poignant and from the heart.  She's had a hard time finding her true self in the shadows of her larger-than-life men and marriages and she persists despite the setbacks and enjoys the adventures. <br /> <br />The first half of the book is almost identical to her earlier book, Twist of Lennon in 1989.  I've not read much about her or Julian from 1980 on and it is interesting to look at behind-the-scenes reflections vs. what the public sees.  Julian: Sing again in your own key and forget about Them. <br /> <br />If you are a '42-years And Counting' Beatles fan like me, then  you will enjoy this book.  There are some unreleased pictues you'll relish from Cyn's family album. <br /> <br />All You Need Is Love, oh yeah, yet there wuz a lot of hurtin' souls along Penny Lane besides Eleanor Rigby or Sgt. Pepper. The price of fame which is not fleeting here. <br /> <br />Donna Coulson
N I read this book 5 years ago when I was preparing to go to Boot Camp.  I'm now out of the Corps after serving my four years and am proud to be a Marine.  I don't remember the book too well specifically.  But I do remember that it let me know what to expect in Boot Camp.  Coming in I had a better idea of what it would be like, and so it was advantageous.  Although no one can know what it is truly like without actually going, this is a pretty good discription.  It does seem kind of censored with what I know really happens at PI.  But that's good, we don't need \\"mothers of america\\" watering down our training any more than they already have.  They don't need to know. <br /> <br />Semper Fi
N I have searched and searched for a great Arthurian retelling and have been disappointed with the ones I have ventured into reading. I was somewhat skeptical when I picked up Nancy McKenzie's Queen of Camelot. This two-novels-in-one compilation is based on Guenevere, from her point of view, in first person narrative, and is 623 pages long in very small print. I didn't want to waste my time reading something this big only to be disappointed at the end. I nevertheless gave the book a whirl. Glad I did! This is one of the most compelling and beautifully told retells I have ever read! McKenzie gives us a detailed story about Guenevere from her point of view. She tells us about the prophecy on the day she was born, how she spends her childhood as an adventurous tomboy, how people fear her and treat her differently as she grows up, how the knights around her battle with the Saxons, and how all of the prophecies come true. She meets Arthur, marries him and later has a love affair with Lancelot, something based on the original tale. But the novel has so much more than that. You will see how this story of magic, prophecies, love and betrayal transpires in an altered, detailed and beautiful light. There are many twists throughout the novel.<br /><br />Guenevere is developed in such an abundant, three-dimensional way in this novel. She is no longer just the pagan beauty who marries a Christian, betrays him and destroys all of Camelot as a result. She is a complex character with flaws as well as virtues in this offering. Arthur is also written in a more interesting, compelling way here, but it is Lancelot that once again blows me away. I have always romanticized Sir Lancelot and McKenzie does not disappoint me in her version of the loyal, chivalrous knight. Merlin and Morgan Le Fay are written with much complexity and nuance as well. This novel, however, does not focus so much on the love triangle between Guenevere, Arthur and Lancelot as much as her inability to supply an heir for Arthur and her affection for Arthur's bastard son, the traitorous Mordred. The overall story is magnificent. Once again, I say that McKenzie did a wonderful job bringing Guenevere to life. She turns this character into a strong, intelligent, complex, three-dimensional, flesh and blood woman, someone you will feel a great deal of affinity with. She is not portrayed as a simple-minded, traitorous hussy in this one! I loved the fanciful storytelling style that made me turn the pages until the wee hours of the night. Some of my friends who read the book along with me complained about it being too long-winded. I didn't think it was long-winded at all. In fact, I wish it had been longer. I loved this book and I look forward to giving Grail Prince a whirl.for Arthur and her affection for Arthur's bastard son, the traitorous Mordred. The overall story is magnificent.

N This book is great! Written as seen by one of the characters of the book keeps you intrigued throughout the whole book. Michael Frederick is a great author, that honest, brutal, poignant, and doesn't skirt the issue. Wish more books were written this way.
N This author will be on the Coast2Coast radio show tonight 10/13/05 at 10PM PT. I will do a review at that time.

This is one of those books that will stir you up, make you ask questions, and allow you to accept the answers. My review will be posted after the George Noory interview...
N By the time we get to \\"Guardsman of Gor,\\" the 15th of John Norman's Counter-Earth novels, we are clearly in a transitional period.  I did not like the idea that instead of Tarl Cabot we were now telling the story of a different Earth man who ends up on Gor, although the Jason Marshall trilogy was more interesting to me than the story of Judy Thornton, a woman brought to Gor as a captive in \\"Slave Girl of Gor.\\"  In the first volume of the trilogy, \\"Fighting Slave of Gor,\\" Marshall ends up on Gor when he tries to save Beverly Henderson from a Gorean slave trap.  The next thing the civilized Earth man knows he is a slave on Gor.  Starting out as the silk slave of the Lady Florence of Vonda, Marshall then becomes a Gorean gladiator, which gives him the opportunity to become free so that he can find Beverly, who now also a slave on Gor.<br /><br />\\"Rogue of Gor\\" is the middle volume in the trilogy and the novel and has Marshall searching for Beverly.  But since this is a trilogy you know that he is not going to find her until the final volume, \\"Guardsman of Gor.\\"  Instead, Marshall travels along the River Vosk to the port city of Victoria, north of Port Kar, and finds himself in the middle of a war between Glorious Ar and the Salerian Confederation as the pirate fleet seeks to control the waterways of Gor on which the cities are so dependent.  In terms of providing more action than sex, this is the one volume of the trilogy that delivers on that score and if you are waiting for Jason and Beverly to consummate their relationship in Gorean terms you have the last half of the next novel for all of that to play out (after a giant naval battle).  In this one he finds her on the slaver's block, buys her, and sets her free even though she insists she is a true slave and therefore does not desire freedom.<br /><br />There is a sense in which Norman is trying to get back to the basics, since the fight between Ar and the Salerian Confederation is not, at face value, part of the gigantic struggle between the Priest-Kings and the Kurii.

N Prior to reading this book, I didn't think I had major limiting beliefs but the exercises that Cole-Whittaker takes you through helped me uncover some I hadn't even realized I had. <br /> <br />If something has kept you from reaching your potential and you can't quite figure out what, pick up this book and uncover your personal obstacles. <br /> <br />Cole-Whittaker is a minister and does refer to God often in the book. If that bothers you, try to figure out a way to get around the references because this book may do wonders for you. I personally subscribe to the Higher Power so it was fine with me.
N When I first received the book, I was a little disappointed. For an expensive book, it's very thin and has large print, which makes it look like a children's book.  <br />   However, the artwork is absolutely beautiful! Most of the myths in it are ones that I haven't read anywhere else. It also divides the myths into seperate eras - ex The Stone Age, The Iron Age, etc.
N Covers only the first beta of Sql 2005.  Many examples don't work.  Talks about features not in the product or that work very differently.  Also not written for developers.  I agree with the other review--it really is for beginners only.
N Everything I have tried in this book is delicious, even when the ingredients aren't 100% fresh from Nantucket.  The are easy and simple to prepare as well.
N It's not a propriate bood for beginer to study NMR knowledge, but good for teachers to prepare class teaching materials.
N All around, Dove was a pretty good book. It was basically about this sixteen year old boy who loves boats. He takes a trip around the world to see what people and their different cultures are like. Even though he was in love with sailing, he did not really know the dangerous things that could happen to him while he was on his adventure. The protagonist of the story is obviously the boy(Robin Graham, because he was the main character. For the theme of this story, I would say that \\" Dont judge a book by its cover\\", would be one that makes a lot of sense. Another book that I would also reccomend would be Maiden Voyage, by Tania Aebi. This is what I thought about the book \\" Dove.\\" Once again, it was a great read.
N Terry McMillan's characters are real, alive and easy to relate to. I appreciate her writing because it speaks to your heart and helps you understand yourself and others. This book is a must read because it is not filled with flashy clichs but still grabs and keeps your attention until the very end. But It!
N very informative on various aspects of astrology ranging from generalities about signs to history of the signs. i was highly interesting and is a great informative tool for a light reading of your sign and a more extensive one.
N I was hoping that the book would be better than the television show, and it wasn't. The show, with its amusing quips, puns and overreaching pseudointellectual analyses of female behavior, is entertaining in a vegetative sort of way. The book should have had more depth. Yes, I'm sure there are women in NYC who claim to be looking for love as they hop from bed to bed hoping to change men into what they want. I hope to high Heaven that the denizens of real NYC are nothing like the flaky women in Candace Bushnell's Sex In The City. Mr. Big is just as egregious in the book as he's portrayed in the HBO show. On the plus side, Patricial Field does a great job with Carrie's wardrobe on the show.
Y Champlin bravely asserts his own contribution to the great wealth of Neronian scholarship for the critics to pick apart. I find very little to quibble about.<br />It is difficult to write even-handedly about Nero for a Western audience. Who could forget the image of a man who \\"fiddled while Rome burned\\" or the terrible tyrant who had begun a nearly 170 year \\"persecution\\" of the early Christians, under whose reign both Peter and Paul were executed? As other reviewer comments reveal, you can easily earn the brand of a Nero \\"apologist\\" if you don't tow the party line, however inaccurate it might be.<br /><br />Champlin's thesis can be stated simply as follows: many, if not most of Nero's grandstands and outrageous actions, were performed out of considerable political shrewdness and calculation - not the madness or puerile excess wrongly attributed to a \\"live fast, die young, and leave a good looking corpse\\" emperor. Nero's success, Champlin argues in the first chapter, is evinced by a shockingly prolonged \\"afterlife\\" manifested in pseudo-Neros, Judeo-Christian apocalyptic writings, and a disenfranchised populace openly lamenting his death. Nonetheless, I cannot help but wonder, (working on the same assumption,) whether he had truly orchestrated his public relations as well as Champlin suggests given his untimely demise at age 30.<br /><br />Some reviewers disagree, but I reckon Champlin's original Nero-Periander link to be one of the most intriguing ideas in ancient biography I've ever seen. The ambivalent relationship with the mother, the Philhellenism, the artistic bent, and the numerous other links are too compelling to ignore outright, even if the conclusion a hard sell. Further research is warranted, but I suspect that Champlin, with his great intellect and energy, may have already exhausted all of the available evidence for advancing his thesis. He demonstrates the Augustus/Antony connections thoroughly. The discussion of the great fire of 64 is arrestingly well done: after convincingly presenting the defense for Nero's innocence, he suddenly shatters the deception in stating that despite this preceding evidence, Nero undoubtedly held direct responsibility for the coflagration. It hits you with dramatic effect almost equal to one of the primary sources comprising the centerpiece of his proof in this sudden reversal: Tacitus' Annales XV.67.<br /><br />Champlin's organization is somewhat bothersome as it is in \\"Final Judgments,\\" because he rejects chronological arrangement for thematic foci. This requires repetition of several facts, and I cannot understand his reasons for the chapter order. The post-mortem legacy of Nero, being most fascinating, he puts up front obviously to hook his reader. It serves as an interesting set piece for further discourse, because the inevitable wonder we feel about Nero's impression on the world ever after demands explanation: thus the rest of the book. But with Dio, Suetonius, and Tacitus unfolding the bulk of their own histories so methodically, the rearrangement isn't always a neat fit. Still, Champlin's brilliant weaving together of hundreds of sources, as before, vindicates his literary decisions several times over.<br /><br />Champlin, like any other historian, has his hypotheses and directs his evidence toward proving them. His presentation however, is replete with past scholarship and primary sources presented candidly and fairly. One of the most appreciable inclusions is the extensive collection of Latin graffiti, which add a critical dimension to our knowledge. This book has been for me an introduction into full-strength Neronian scholarship and I found it both accessible and empowering enough to read further with confidence.ngly presenting the defense for Nero's innocence, he suddenly shatters the deception in stating that despite this preceding evidence, Nero undoubtedly held direct responsibility for the coflagration.

N While I don't always agree with his TV analysis, I enjoy Mr. Crawford's commentaries. His book, however, is surprisingly shallow and can be summed up in one chapter with footnotes. I didn't realize an intentional misquoting of Thomas Jefferson on page 2 (easy enough to catch as the footnote provides the actual quote) was a foreshadowing of the paraphrasing to come. Almost all his sources are the very media he criticizes.    Yes, the media should be astute and critical of anyone in power anywhere, yet it isn't, mostly because it has been corporatized. vilified and because reporters and organizations have wimped out. OK, yes, and....?     Since Crawford is a journalist, one who claims an inside view of what really goes on, he is obligated by the same standards he poses not just to say this is what went on, but to explain why manipulation is allowed and what to do about it. Tom Fenton in his book, Bad News, does a more thorough job of explaining the links between money and reporting and providing a context for media manipulation and journalistic reticence.     Crawford gives specific examples of manipulation, but doesn't provide motive or context beyond the trite \\"politicians manipulate the media so they can look better so they can become powerful.\\" Therein lies the point, if the media is powerful enough that it needs to be manipulated, then it is powerful enough to hold its own. Why hasn't the media held its own and why aren't people demanding a real public discussion? What does the messenger do with the message he was supposed to deliver?    Crawford says people are tuning to outlets to verify their beliefs so news outlets are becoming customer-driven reinforcing agents. If that's true, why is the media making that choice instead of taking the lead? Politicians do attack the messenger, but often they don't have to, because the messenger has been co-opted. More dangerously, by giving hyperbole public time and space, the news media cuts its own throat then calls it a tracheotomy.    Still, despite the flaws, I stayed with the book's limited scope until page 117. \\"I don't vote....\\" With that, Crawford's credibility flew out the window.     \\"I fear it will make it more difficult to keep my observations down the middle.\\" After 116 pages of caterwalling about professional and personal responsibility, about the consequences to democracy of a media manipulated by power, about how the media is responsible to its constituents, the public, and should judge both the quality and importance of its \\"message,\\" Crawford absolves himself of any duty, responsibility or personal judgment. His book becomes a version of \\"do as I say, not as I do.\\" Worse yet, the core of his argument is a tautology: journalists must give up the rights and responsibilities of citizenship to uphold the rights and responsibilitites of citizenship. Talk about attacking the messenger, the messenger just committed suicide.     Come on, get in the muck with the rest of us, make tough decisions, make judgments. It's in the choosing that one gains perspective and insight. Not voting because you're a journalist is like saying a Yankee fan can't write about baseball or deciding not to eat anything, ever, so no one will know you don't like brocolli.    As Jim Hightower put it, \\"There ain't nothin' in the middle of the road but yellow stripes and dead armadillos.\\"
N This book was written for those who want to learn more about the operation of the daily stock market. The book is definitely not light reading.  Charts and technical aspects abound. If you are a novice, you must actually study the material to fully understand it. This book along with \\"How to make money in stocks\\",and 'The Successful Investor\\" both by O'Neil should be used as text books for anyone who is serious about the stock market
N Mr. Andersons' book provides a thorough examination, diagnosis, and best possible cure for what ails black america. Not poor whites, hispanics, arabs, jews, gays, or white women. You owe it to you and your family to at least check out the facts of this examination and then decide.  <br /> <br />White america has always put their modus operandi in our face; this is our society, these are our rules, do the best you can with what we decide to give you; don't bother me while I make my money. If you do, the police will handle you. <br /> <br />Here is Black americas' call to focus on what should have been the legacy of civil rights - economic empowerment.
N For the operaholics among us (I am one) \\"Fortissimo\\" is an entertaining and interesting look at what goes on backstage at the opera. Author Murray was given unprecedented access to Lyric Opera of Chicago's Opera Center for American Artists during the 2003-2004 season. This is Lyric Opera's training ground for young artists. Murray follows this group of twelve singers through coaching sessions, rehearsals, auditions and performances to give the reader a close-hand look at the rigorous intensity of this most glorious art form. Interspersed with this are chapthers which fill out the picture of what it takes to succeed in opera. There is a chapter devoted to the comprimario - singers who specialize in secondary characters. Another chapter is devoted to Pavarotti, a warning of what can happen when one achieves what Murray dubs 'sacred monster' status. A sacred monster, superstar, Pavarotti was undone at the end of his career by his enormous ego. This book is a wonderful gift for those opera lovers on your Christmas list this season.
N As far as Henry County (and all of central Indiana) ghost stories are concerned, this book is as comprehensive as I've ever seen. I was born and raised in Henry County, and still live here, and I have heard a lot of the stories going around. I've been to a lot of the sites mentioned. Ms. Perry did a wonderful job covering the history, both factual and reported. The grammatics and punctuation leave something to be desired, but it is nothing that hindered my enjoyment of these stories. <br /> <br />
N Learning From The Tanya by Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz is the second volume in the \\"Definitive Commentary on the Moral and Mystical Teaching\\" series focusing on the Kabbalah. The first volume of the series, \\"Opening the Tanya\\" discussed the first section of the original text of Hasidic Master Rabbi Schneur Zalman of Liadi's \\"Tanya\\". This second volume takes on the next major portion of the Tanya, offering the definitive explanation and commentary providing the reader with a guide toward harmony of body and soul, of earthliness and transcendence, and a higher level or awareness and understanding with our human potential with respect to a relationship with God. A scholar, teacher, scientist, author, mystic, and social critic, Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz is a world recognized expert on this subject, and Learning From The Tanya is confidently recommended reading for students of Judaic mysticism and the Kabbalah in general, and the Tanya in particular. <br /> <br />
N I found the story very silly.First: Its not romantic.Second:The heroine is very vain.Three: The language doesn't look like Penny Jordan, it sounded cheap especially when the heroine says baby grub and talkes about her vibrator Roger. <br /> <br />These books are supposed to be silly likable love stories, then of talking about about vibrators etc.   <br /> <br />  <br />
Y This book has been fascinating to read. It is evident, as a student of comparative religion, that the author has done some careful research and integrated it successfully in the book. A lot has to be said for some major research flaws, such as often referring to Sufis (Islamic mystics) and Mosques, even though Islam wasn't to arrive for another 650 years! Overall, it is an entertaining book and will provide you with an interesting alternative for the life of Jesus, an alternative that is likely, not fictional.<br /><br />Enjoy, but do filter the content.
N THe book was good as always and Jim Dale consistently puts the emotion and voices to the book that creates a don't stop listening pleasure. Also a great price at amazon!!!

N Dr. Harding's book, The Magic of Christmas/Christmas Unwrapped/X-mas Files is a fantastic and well researched book. Word to the wise. The Magic of Christmas is identical to Christmas Unwrapped and the X-mas Files by the same author. The publisher, for some unknown and absurd reason, republished this book under three different titles with three different publication dates.  <br /> <br />The overall theme of the book is excellent for showing the Amanita muscaria mushroom/shamanic origins of the Christmas story and even goes into some archaeoastronomy.  <br /> <br />Much of this same information has been revealed by James Arthur in Mushrooms and Mankind and by James Bursenos in The Resurrection of Santa Claus - (republished) Shaman's Drum Issue 68, 2005. Dr. Harding was probably the first to discover the information, and probably the last to go to print with it. James Arthur (2000) uses many of the same associations in his book (with no references - plagiarism?) and radio shows that he very likely took \\"some\\" material from Harding. Harding's book(s) are far better and more readable than James Highfield - The Physics of Christmas (1998), etc., which bases much of the work on Harding, though strays off numerous times into unrelated material. <br /> <br />However, save your money and only buy one of the 3 different versions of the book. I'm glad I needed extra Christmas presents, but I was actually looking forward to reading \\"further\\" research by Dr. Harding, not the same book under three different titles. I'm very disappointed in the deceptive tactics of his publisher not informing the public that they're all the same damn book. They don't even appear to be different editions. Same material, same page numbers, same everything page for page.  <br /> <br />Buy it, but only buy one.
N I would highly encourage anyone who is potty training a \\"book-loving\\" toddler to get this book. My son asks to have this read to him everytime we go into the potty.  <br />It's nice to have a little pattern going with him.  <br />Read the book, wash hands, get dressed.  <br />
N Being a stalwart fan of the fantasy genre I decided to put my skepticism aside, break down and give these \\"children's\\" books a go. This series is in line with a lot of classic entertainment touted as \\"children's\\" fare (e.g., original Bugs Bunny cartoons, The Hobbit, Chronicles of Narnia, among others): that is, much of it is aimed straight at the heart of adults. And it hits the mark.    I have finished the series up to Book Five and I must say that there have been some pretty grisly incidents for younger readers. However, one can assume that many of Rowling's younger readers have followed the books from the beginning, and grown as Harry Potter did. For the younger readers just starting, however, along about book four some of the material may be a tad startling or disconcerting.    In any case, I have found the writing to be thoroughly entertaining, particularly the effective use of tongue-in-cheek humor. There is a comical brattiness about many of the characters (professors, parents, and students alike) which plays pretty well. The childishness of the main characters can be a bit trying at times, I will admit; but it is forgivable and understandable...they are, after all, still kids.    The use of suggestion and mystery -- of questions that do not get answered till the end of the book -- can also be a bit trying at times, but it is also compelling and intriguing at the same time, and part of this author's trademark.    All in all, these are exciting, fast-paced books, truly classics in their own time, and I am duly impressed that they lived up to their hype in my mind, skeptic that I was. Five stars, for cripe's sake.
N To high school and my best friend and her boyfriend. It was scary how realistic this book is. It's a beautiful love story that had me up all night reading, I finished it in one day. A true page turner, comedy and tear jerker. A real quick read. Buy It!

N this boook was a great one that you could learn from. it not only teaches the imponrtance of family and their values but it also deals with basic issues that teens and some kids even deal with.  this book is about 4 best friends who are for the first time in their lives spending their summer apart. one day they are all in one of the girls rooms and finds a pair of pants that were tucked away in her closet.  once all four  of them try them on they realize that there is really something special about these pants.  seeming as how all 4 girls are differnt shapes and sizes and somehow the pants fit all of them,  they realize that these pants were the start of something special.  immediatley following they decided to make up certian rules abut the pants such as you must write the best thing u did while wearing the pants over your summer on the right leg and also some silly things such as to \\"never pick yuor nose while wearing the pants.\\"  this book follows the girls throuh their summers in differnt places of the world and through all of the different obstacles that life takes them through. it can really teach you alot not only about what is going on around you but most imporntantly about yuorself.  i would give this book 4 stars and would reccommend it to anyone who seems the slihgtest bit interested.
N If you are looking for something to stimulate your brain, this isn't it.  However, if you are just looking for a good laugh, you'll enjoy The Bad Girl's Guide.  It's funny and light, and definitely a good way to pass a little bit of time.
N never read it-a young relative idicated he liked it and somehow my name popped upon this--no more to say
N Though she is honored to be Chicago Woman of the Year, Victoria Colby-Camp is more euphoric over the mental improvement that her son Jim has shown recently especially since he and Tasha North fell in love.  Jim was snatched almost twenty years ago when he was seven and turned into the killing Seth whose goal was to murder Victoria for abandoning him.  However, her elation would turn to despair if she knew Seth resurfaced and started to rape a pregnant Tasha.<br /><br />Former military strategist Daniel Marks is in town complements of the Colby Agency that wants to hire him.  Also in Chicago is Emily Hastings whose father a veteran homicide detective was murdered.  She finds letters linking her dad to Victoria, the woman's long ago murdered first husband James, and her dad's first partner Marelyn Rutland that confuses her.  Soon she will meet Daniel and they will be embroiled in the COLBY CONSPIRACY that goes back almost two decades ago.<br /><br />Though the subplots can become confusing at first, once the audience comprehends how this complex superb suspense thriller starts to come together, they will want more Colby Agency tales; (see FILES FROM THE COLBY AGENCY: THE BODYGUARD'S BABY PROTECTIVE CUSTODY).  The ensemble cast is solid as fans will feel with Victoria who has overcome so much tragedy, hope Jim \\"defeats\\" Seth with Tasha at his side, and root for Daniel and Emily to make it while wondering what really happened two decades ago.  A final twist marks a strong Webb of deceit tale that showcases a fine author on her A-game.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
N Review based on a cursory examination by University of Phoenix students in Philosophy 251.  <br />We have found the book to be well organized, and detailed. The structure placed the information in an easy to read and presentable manner. <br />The use of strong and sound proofs by experiment and examples supported the overall logic of reasoning in a clear and concise manner. <br />We have found the book to be well thought out and laid out so the reader can learn and follow what is being explained. <br />
N My only complaint is that this book was a bit repetative, and Holden's vocabulary only consists of 4 words: sonuvabitch, goddamn, lousy and phony. It was still quite humorous and the actual story was interesting.<br /><br />It was easy to read and to relate to, so you should pick it up if you're looking for a fun read. Some people complain about the lack of a plot, but to understand this book you need to read deeper into it. It's actually a lot more than some annoying kid's list of complaints about life.<br /><br />The story is about Holden Caulfield's coming of age and realizing that growing up is not a process that can be stopped. He had a lousy childhood, as he puts it, and wants to save other children from going though the things he experienced in his life. He is telling the story from a mental institution, which he was placed in after returning home from the fourth Prep school he had been kicked out of. He flashes back to the events leading up to his arrival at his home and tells the story of those 3 days.
N This book is chilling and depressing indeed, though very well written and sprinkled with frequent humor.  I was sort of surprised however by the comment in Publisher's Weekly which said that \\"PW suspects that many of those buyers will be disappointed. Ehrenreich can't deliver the promised story because she never managed to get employed in the 'midlevel corporate world' she wanted to analyze.\\"  I never viewed that as being the \\"promised story\\" in the first place.  To me, the primary point of the book was to describe what it was like to actually try to ENTER that world in the first place rather than describing what life was like when she got there--and that she did.  In fact, I actually thought that she \\"lucked out\\" in a sense by having the bizarre, surreal experiences she did--not only did it make for more entertaining and more thought-provoking reading, but in my mind, if she HAD obtained a job right away, it would have taken away the whole raison d'etre of the book.  It would have been a completely different book in which she merely described her (presumably) boring mid-level corporate job, which probably would have been the same from day to day.  Thus, at least for purposes of writing the book, I think she was \\"lucky\\" that things worked out the way they did.  As for the reader who criticized her for not taking the \\"jobs\\" offered by AFLAC and Mary Kay, I thought those comments were bizarre.  I agree with Ms. Ehrenreich's point in that \\"jobs\\" such as these in which the employer offers no salary, no benefits, no office, no help and essentially takes no risk whatsoever can hardly be considered jobs in the traditional sense she was seeking.  In any event, it's really a pretty scary and depressing book, but one which I recommend.
N When looking for &lt;a href=\\"[...]\\">lock picking books&lt;/a>, this one is very informative. It will give one great ideas on opening padlocks, but the language is very basic, no frills here. This is not a romance novel, it's how to open locks without keys, and that's it. You will learn what you need to here. But you should always seek out more knowledge.
Y Never been much for enjoying history, but the style, brevity, and choice of subject matter come together very nicely in this book.
N If you enjoy a well told yarn of intrigue told so skillfully you are not able to predict the ending, a really good who-done-it, this is for you.
N I thoroughly enjoyed reading Faith is a verb by Chris Goodrich. The book covers facts regarding the history of the organization Habitat for Humanity and the author's experiences volunteering. Goodrich writes about the places, the people, and the volunteers he has encountered during his five-year experience with Habitat for Humanity. The author speaks straight from the heart, some of which brought tears to my eyes, some of sadness, some of laughter. Even through all the heart-wrenching sights, Goodrich and his crew persevere, regardless of the obstacles they face. Goodrich's experiences include traveling around the world, from America to London from London to Paraguay even getting lost in the Sierra, Faith is a Verb, is a fantastic read. In addition, the book opens a person's eyes and heart to the devastation and suffering that many see everyday of their lives. The book puts into perspective just how lucky we are even though we may not think so; it made me not only look at my ethics and values but also encouraged me to pick up that hammer.
Y If you are stumped for the perfect gift to bring to your dinner host, to give to your dinner guests, or for any other small gift occasion, Furry Logic is the answer.  Everyone loves this book.
N Whether intentional or not, this book's audience is the former or current military member.  But if you have read and enjoyed works such as the first two volumes of \\"Roots of Strategy\\", you should have no trouble following this book.    The author successfully shows that military personnel have mixed feelings about war.  Although he addresses behavior in the midst of battle, the author seems more interested in the views about war held by those outside war itself, i.e., those who had not yet experienced it and those who were looking backward in retrospect.  How those people felt in the midst of the madness is almost certainly different from how they anticipated or how they adjusted their feelings afterwards.  I think this \\"flavor\\" derives from his personal-interview-and-historical-research approach.  I do not see this as a negative but rather staying within his scope of knowledge and expertise.    The review titled \\"Flawed work of a historian with no sociological credibility\\" seems too harshly critical.  Perhaps this reviewer expected a highly technical, in-depth psychological approach.  As a note: page 58 cites S.L.A. Marshall as stating that only \\"some 15 per cent of American infantrymen fired.\\"  True, the subject of women in the military is barely broached.  However, in all fairness, the author never pretends to have extensive knowledge about how women react in battle and simply doesn't go there.  Perhaps that is a deficiency of character, but not of the book.  I get the feeling that this review didn't find what he wanted and then \\"skimmed\\" the book without thinking into what was being presented.      Although now much more interested in peace studies, I enjoyed reading this book.  I found a number of passages that shed light on where I have been and where I seek to go.  I don't see this as a pro-military book although at times it may seem so.  I characterize it as an honest endeavor to address and understand some of the difficult questions that most of us have concerning death and killing in war-time.
N Temple to the wind is a riveting account of the Reliance story. I would also put it right up there with Seabiscuit and In the Heart of the Sea. The book is expertly written and extremely well researched. I found the biographical material about Herreshoff, Barr and Lipton very interesting. I especially enjoyed the fast paced play by play action of the races between Reliance and Shamrock III. I highly recommend Temple to the Wind.
Y At last... a comprehensive visual compendium of the most celebrated artistic promotional film marketing campaign worldwide... almost.  You would think that the opulent Mr. Sansweet would have in his possession every single poster to have ever rolled off the printing press for this unprecedented franchise but several of my favorite foreign one-sheets, daybills, banners and bus stop posters are notably missing.  Does this mean that Mr. Sansweet has not aquired all of them in his envious collection of Star Wars memorabilia?  Not likely.  Chances are he has every single one of them... locked away somewhere within the bowels of his coveted archives.  Most notably absent is the lack of reference material specifically promoting Revenge of the Sith and would seem to indicate that this book was completed and ready to be published just prior to the film's theatrical exhibition, but there is a plethora of wonderful international promotional material such as the six character U.K. bus stop posters that are much more visually exciting than the disappointing U.S. domestic ad campaign that demands to be published.  This can only mean that another volume must be sure to follow.  Still, there are enough international poster variations out there to keep collectors like myself and presumably Mr. Sansweet himself scouring the farthest reaches of the globe and the galaxy for years to come.
N I find \\"Photoshop  for Nature Photographers : A Workshop in a Book\\" to be a great book to add to your PhotoShop library.  It adds some great insight by several of the world's best known nature photographers.  Any book that has instructional information from John Shaw, Arthur Morris, Charles Glatzer, and Joe McDonald is well worth the investment. <br /> <br />One of the most difficult aspects of PhotoShop for me has been the effective use of curves.  Tim and Ellen do a much better job at helping with this complex matter than any other book I have read. <br /> <br />The effective utilization of PhotoShop requires as much of an artistic approach as it does as workflow approach.  Tim and Ellen do a very good job of fully developing a great workflow while introducing their own artistic approach. <br /> <br />No one book can every include all the aspects of PhotoShop that you will every need.  However, \\"Photoshop for Nature Photographers : A Workshop in a Book\\" does a great job of specilizing for nature photographers.  As with any workshop, it does require the student to do some work to get the most out of the class. <br /> <br />I recommend this book to any nature photographer who would like to improve their utilization and knowledge of PhotoShop. <br />
N I love Aristotle and this is a good collection, but my book fell apart!  I had a course that used just this book, and despite the fact that we all took good care of our copies, nearly all of our books tore in half or lost pages.  Some actually had to make a new book out of it!
N To his discredit, Dr. Unwin virtually brags in the introductory chapter that nearly all of the questions and arguments that have mystified pterosaurs since their discovery have been answered in recent years,  but when it comes time to reveal those answers, Unwin typically sidesteps. Origins? Still not sure. Family tree? With over a hundred genera to choose from,  and many recently discovered, Unwin falls back on a favorite few and places them on an antique tree, not a modern cladogram. While Unwin's writing style is refreshing and easy to read (every chapter opens with short fiction), and his photos are first rate, the line work is rarely original and never detailed. Almost nothing is shown from the neck down. Only skulls are presented. Most, if not all, of the drawings  are recognizable from other sources. So, a disappointed reader here.
N Hands down, the funniest book I've ever read.  It's touching, frustrating, and poignant.  I even related to this character, and I'm a 35 year-old woman.    <br /> <br />Read it, you won't regret it! <br /> <br />
N I read this book over a couple of days.  It was hard to put down.  The things I liked best about this book were very interesting characters that made you think hard about them, a plot filled with suspense to the end, multiple subplots that merged well together, and a lean writing style that let me focus mostly on the characters and the provocative web I found them in.  This is a very thougthfully crafted story. I think most anyone would enjoy this novel.  Highly recommended.
N During the reign of Henry VIII, at fourteen Elizabeth Meredith inherited Friarsgate when her mother and older middle sister married and moved onto their respective spouses' estate and her oldest sibling and her husband chose the king's court.  Eight years later she remains independent running her estate until her mother informs her she must marry so that an heir can inherit Friarsgate.<br /><br />Her beloved sixty years old Uncle Thomas agrees to escort the feisty landowner to court.  However, before they leave for London, Baen MacColl comes from Scotland at the behest of his father to discus a sheep deal.  As the two die in the wool anti-marital soul mates fall in love, Elizabeth chaperoned by her uncle travels to the king's court.  There she befriends the beleaguered queen while Henry VIII begins his campaign to replace his wife Katherine with Anne.<br /><br />The key to this battle between two independent obstinate loving combatants is the background that incorporates Henry's antics as he sets in motion his plan to remove Katherine of Aragon as queen and replace her with Anne Boleyn.  Bertrice Small cleverly uses the monumental sixteenth century events to tell her story of love yet in some ways the shadow overwhelms the lead characters.  Fans of historical romance with strong doses of both will enjoy the latest Meredith tale (see UNTIL YOU AND PHILIPPA).<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
N Due to deregulation, a national company holding a monopoly in the transportation industry requested my consulting services to prepare for this upcoming change. Using Dr. Cohen's book as my reference and bench-mark, I could easily follow and prepare a solid consulting proposal, and when accepted, to work it out and present it successfully. I strongly recommend this book to consulting novices and veterans alike.
N This book isn't merely a primer for capitalist thinking, it is a Bible for free enterprise.  Everyone on the planet should read MILLIONAIRE REPUBLICAN, then utilize the implements provided.  The result would be a peaceful, hard-working universe. <br /> <br />I look forward to the day Mr. Root becomes a novelist and weaves his philosophy through the prism of fiction.  MOVE OVER, AYN RAND.
N The Outlander series are my favorite books of all time, period.  But after reading the Fiery Cross, I was a bit let down, as many people were, and afraid that the rest of the series would just continue to go downhill.  So when A Breath of Snow and Ashes came out, I was so glad to see that it was getting good reviews.  I finally got to read it this week and was not disappointed in the least. <br />All the characters we know and love are back, and Brianna seems to have finally grow up.  She has been my least favorite character since the second book, but this time around she was actually likeable (for the most part).  At certain points this book became so intense that I actually had to put it down and take a break for awhile, but not all readers will have this experience, only ones that are practically obsessed with this series (and who's friends have to remind them, \\"Jamie is NOT a real person!).    <br />So basically, if you have read the previous books, just read this one. Please.  You won't regret it.  The only reason I didn't give this one five stars is that I think nothing can top Outlander and Dragonfly in Amber.  If I could give this 4.5, I would. <br /> <br />One thing I have wondered about - if Claire dies back in the 1700's, then she'll be born again in 1918, go back in time in 1946, die in the 1700's, be born in 1918, and just keep repeating this forever.  For all she knows this could be her tenth time doing this.  I haven't seen this matter dealt with in the books.  Did I just miss it or something?
N It must be difficult-given the plethora of books on Lincoln-to shed new light on an old subject.  However, Elizabeth Brownstein does. Through careful and thorough research, Ms. Brownstein addresses issues hitherto unexplored. Lincoln's summer home...provides a suitable setting to describe Lincoln's activities outside the White House.  One learns, for instance, that the first draft of the Emancipation Proclamation was completed here. One also learns that, far from being a retreat from the hustle and bustle of Pennsylvania Avenue, the home facilitated Lincoln's open-mindedness about receiving virtual strangers at virtually any hour of the day or night and resulted in serious sleep deprivation.  <br /> <br />However, it was in the other topics addressed in the book that Lincoln's character is at its most illuminating. His fascination with weaponry, his patience in his dealings with his wife, and his ability to establish collegial relationship with people of vastly differing temperaments are all thoughtfully explored...The characters highlighted are dispassionately analyzed in such a way as to enable the reader to be part of the scene at all times.  For instance, Lincoln's wife, so often pilloried...is given a fair hearing and is properly depicted as a courageous soul confronted by agonizing choices and exaggerated expectations of the First Lady's performance as a suitable consort of the most admired President in American History...Mrs. Brownstein provides a valuable service for readers interested in the less dramatic, but no less insightful, clues about Lincoln the President, confronted, as he was, by the unprecedented challenges associated with his era. <br />
N This book was right on and what i had been looking for to help me understand the men in my life whether the men i date or family memembers. My guy is a \\"Fence Sitter\\", i always new it wasn't me. He's exactly what it says in the book. Thanks to the authors i will use their book as a guide to men. I hope they write more books like this.
N I enjoyed reading Eragon. Now I am reading it to my 3 boys. I was constantly amazed that it was written by someone who was so young. I was captivated by each page and I could not wait to find out what happened next.  My boys love sword fighting, dragons, magic and heros and they love Eragon.  We are looking forward to the next book.<br /><br />  Larna
N I was spellbound from the first page; Maggie Shayne has proven her talent again in this novel. I love the vampire stories and hope Maggie will keep on writing them.

N I swear, you've never seen so much manuevering in your life. Page after page, Estrich covers Hillary's butt in increasingly implausible ways. It all gets to a point where one only laughs at the lengths to which some people will go to elect this woman. The Case FOR Hillary Clinton? There isn't one.
N Genuinely witty and fun.  I really liked the incorporation of the cartoon and quotations into the book, this made it more interesting and gave a better perspective on the chapters.  An uplifting read from beginning to end.
N For me, Wolfe's detailing of both the academic and social spheres at Dupont rang true.  As a student at a university driven by both scholarly research and the party scene, I can picture many of the novel's more dramatic scenes.  Some, like the Saint Ray party toward the beginning or the intimidating neuroscience lecture hall, I felt as if i were remembering rather than reading.   <br /> <br />No, there is no university quite like Dupont, succeeding in academics and sports at the highest levels.  If he had not given the school these characteristics, however, Wolfe might have put himself at a disadvantage:  There would be less of a chance for a reader to identify with the university, the characters, the scenes, and his commentary would have been limited to fewer aspects of today's campuses.  A novel about an UNDERachieving university might be interesting as well, but I think the scope of I Am Charlotte Simmons, and Dupont in particular, was well suited to Wolfe's acute powers of observation.
N \\"The Face\\", the first book in this volume, is probably the best of the five Demon Princes novels.  The reasons are manifest.  Villainous Lens Larque provides some of the best challenges and intimidation for our hero, Kirth Gersen.  There's the usual helping of exquisite writing and fine descriptions; the menu items during Gersen's restraunt visits are particularly noteworthy.  Most importantly, \\"The Face\\" is the most morally challenging novel in the series.  It presents, to some extent, the best argument for Gersen abandoning his single-minded hunt for revenge in his abortive attempts at romance with two characters.  Lastly, \\"The Face\\" has a killer ending, laugh-out-loud serious if there ever was such a thing. <br /> <br />Another notable element is the planet Dar Sai and its inhabitants, the Darsh.  Dar Sai is odd even by Vance standards.  Giant umbrellas of water protect folks from searing daytime heat, the women grow mustaches, food is prized for its repulsiveness and gender wars are taken to a whole new level.  Vance scores particular points by showing us the spoiled tourists who visit solely to mock the backwards Darsh.  An just dessert is served for them at the end, of course. <br /> <br />The last novel in the series, \\"The Book of Dreams\\", is competent but less biting than \\"The Face\\".  The new villain, Howard Alan Treesong, is less impressively hateable than Lens Larque or Viole Falshune from \\"The Palace of Love\\".  \\"The Book of Dreams\\" contains vignettes set on numerous planets, none of them particuarly brilliant.  The best parts of this novel are the introductory segments to each chapter.  Short paragraphs cover a wide range of ground, from the hilarious philosophical basis of the Institute to the stunning character introductions for Treesong's various Paladins.
N This is a marvelous and beautifully realized work of fiction. As someone who enjoys mysteries, as well as historical fiction and gothic novels of suspense, I was quite taken with this book. Intricately plotted, the book is clever in its premise. Two disparate human beings, a highly independent, red-headed slip of a woman, Samantha Flood, Australian by birth, and a serious, fervently religious Spaniard, Miguel Madero, who is half-English, find themselves thrust together, as each explores the tiny, remote Cumbrian village of Illthwaite in England, looking for answers to their individual quests.  Both are in Illthwaite to get information relative to that which each is seeking. Both are staying in the local inn, called The Stranger House.<br /><br />Samantha is a brilliant but brash mathematician in her early twenties. Fondly known as Sam to her friends, she is interested in tracing her familial roots. She has recently discovered that her paternal grandmother was from this part of the world,  having been a part of a huge number of children migrants that had been unceremoniously shipped from England to other parts of its Empire, including Australia. Samantha is interested in finding out more about her paternal grandmother and the mystery surrounding her.<br /><br />Miguel, or Mig, as he is known to his family and friends, is the scion of a well-known house of vintners in Spain and is in his late twenties. He is a former seminarian who has suffered from manifestations of what he believes to be stigmata. He also, on occasion, sees ghostly manifestations or visions. Recovering from a serious alpine accident that nearly killed him, he is now in Illthwaite ostensibly to do research  for his thesis on the experience of English Catholics during the Reformation. He is, however, actually in Illthwaite to find out more about an ancestor of his who mysteriously disappeared there centuries ago during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I.<br /><br />In Illthwaite, Both Sam and Mig find themselves up against obstacles placed in their way. It seems that its residents are not totally forthcoming or are reluctant to part with information relative to their respective quests. What they each individually discover is that things are not always as they seem in Illthwaite.  Moreover, their divergent interests are more intertwined than they could ever have imagined. They will discover that they have more in common than they realized, having come full circle in a cosmic design not of their making.<br /><br />This book has well-drawn characters that come alive under the author's expert hand. The plot is unusual, as well as complex, containing many layers that the discerning reader will enjoy exploring. Well-written, as well as intricately plotted, this book crosses a number of genres. With its supernatural portents, historical underpinnings, underlying mystery, as well as its gothic type  suspense and sensibilities, infused with just a dollop of  romance, this book will appeal to those readers who favor these genres. In particular, I found the parts of the book that transcended into historical fiction to be the most compelling. This is not a book for everyone, but to  those for whom its themes have inherent appeal, it is a book to be relished.mselves up against obstacles placed in their way.

Y This is a marvelous read, and those already familiar with the Abel Jones series will not be disappointed.  Again, I am amazed and appreciative of the amount of research that Mr. Parry puts into his novels, and this book is a prime example.  It is a wonderful story that not only entertains, but also enlightens about one of the most important eras in our history, and, one of the most important cities and cultures (New Orleans) in our country.  I couldn't put it down and read it all in one sitting.  Thank again to the author, and I look forward to reading about how the venerable Abel Jones will come to grips with his latest personal struggle regarding family over duty!
N This is a very important book.  We need to change the current tax system and this book will answer all your questions.
N Island a Memoir by Elaine Pace is written from the heart.  A wonderful sharing of a personal journey to a different way of life, in a different place, celebrating different activities. <br />   The descriptions of the Vineyard takes the reader to a special place deep in their memory, yet it is a warm and delightful experience.
N Mark and Alissa's Creative Tax Planner takes the fear out of finances for the creative person. Before I used their book I was a just an amature photographer, but I now I am a confident professional because I know how to handle my money. There is a slot for every type of artistic or business expense so I know what I need to hang on to for tax time.  <br />This book can makes me money and gives me the peace of mind to be able to run a photography business and know that I won't have a big nasty surprise come April 15th.
N The premise of the book is hilarious: Dick and Jane, all grown up and still living in suburbia. But this isn't the suburbia of Ward and June Cleaver. It's the suburbia of \\"Desperate Housewives\\" with a Yiddish twist.<br /><br />It made me nostalgic for my years living in Miami Beach. Oy ve, where did the years go? Even the goyim who didn't grow up hearing Yiddish will love this book.
N If you were stunned by \\"Gridlinked,\\" and left awe-struck by \\"The Line of Polity,\\" then I guarantee you won't be disappointed with \\"Brass Man.\\" Picking up almost immediately after the end of Line, it continues the saga of ECS agent Ian Cormac, and weaves narratives for many characters introduced in the previous two novels - plus several fascinating new ones - into an extremely satisfying whole. Best of all, it brings back one of the most unique and enigmatic of all of Asher's creations - the flawed yet noble Golem Twenty-Five, Mr. Crane.
N This is one of my all time favorite books I could not put it down, the story is Amazing it keeps you wondering till the end, you can't help but feel the pain and views of all the characters even Delia's dad Andrew.
N This attractively illustrated book provides a showcase of Israel's achievements in fields as diverse as agriculture, education, medicine, science and technology. It looks at the technologies, processes and the products from this tiny little land that are improving the lives of so many people. The authors highlight some of the people responsible for this ingenuity that is benefiting the whole world.<br /><br />For example, at the Weizmann Institute, Dr Michal Schwartz has developed a way of harnessing immune system cells to repair and revive damaged nerve fibres. Other medical breakthroughs include the miniscule camera-in-a-tablet used for internal diagnosis, ultrasound for destroying tumours and Israel's highly effective disaster relief operations.<br /><br />A great help to third world people has been the discovery by scientist Yoel Margalith of the Bti bacterium that kills certain kinds of flies and harmful mosquitoes.  This has already saved millions of livers and is an environment-friendly intervention. Most remarkable is that Margalith is a holocaust survivor, of both the Bergen-Belsen and Teresienstadt camps.<br /><br />In many fields Israel is so far ahead of the pack that other countries have no chance of catching up. One of the most interesting innovations developed in Israel is a project to avoid collisions between aircraft and migratory birds. It involved the study of the flight paths of birds. This work of researcher Yossi Leshem is now also used by the Jordanian and Turkish air-force.<br /><br />Israel has more engineers per capita than any other country on earth and a remarkable number of hi-tech companies. Innovation in the fields of computers and information technology is particularly impressive. This encompasses software, operating systems, storage & retrieval systems, verification and firewall technologies, plus a host of mobile phone applications.<br /><br />Israel's creativity is not restricted to science and technology, as there is also much happening in arts and culture. Despite its small size and its many enemies, this country is bursting with creative energy and making a huge contribution to the global marketplace and to quality of life worldwide.<br /><br />The founders of this brave country were aware that Israel had almost no natural resources and that its people therefore had to develop and apply their brainpower. Well, they are succeeding spectacularly. What a pity that Israel has to devote so much of its money and resources to protect itself from its neighbours! If its full genius were given free reign, it would become even more of a blessing to the world.ts small size and its many enemies, this country is bursting with creative energy and making a huge contribution to the global marketplace and to quality of life worldwide.

N I just want to say, that for a used book, this book arrived in great condition.  I think that it even came in shrink wrap!  I'm pleased with my purchase and am glad that I don't have to read through other people's notes and marks as I study for my class.  Good job!
N \\"Last Chance to See\\" is Douglas Adams' hilarious and though-provoking non-fiction, eco-travel narrative about circling the globe in search of some of the Earth's most endangered animals. We get to see a side of Adams that is deeply concerned with the plight of the beautiful, unique, and often ludicrously implausible lifeforms on our planet -- the same side that prompted him to climb Mount Kilimanjaro in a rhino suit.     What made this book all the more meaningful to me was that I'd thought I'd finished all of Douglas Adams' books long ago. I loved them all, but I never fully appreciated the depth of his genius as a humanist and social satirist until, sadly, he had passed away.  What's more, I never realized how much Adams' writings meant to me until I was hit with the cold, hard reality that he'd written all he ever would.  Douglas Adams had hitched his last ride across the galaxy, and I'd never hear from him again.  Or so I thought.    Infinitely improbable as it may seem, I heard from Douglas Adams again about two weeks ago.  I was browsing around in Borders, long since resigned to the fact that I'd read the last \\"new\\" Douglas Adams book I ever would, when I stumbled upon \\"Last Chance to See.\\" I felt like I'd gone into the pet store to buy a parakeet and, instead, found a dodo bird.      The endangered species Douglas Adams criss-crossed the globe in search of are all, in their own ways, remarkable and priceless. He urges us not to wait until they're gone to fully appreciate them, and he drives this point home to today's readers, in his own ironic style, by now being himself \\"extinct.\\"    If you're a Douglas Adams fan, and you've never read this book, here it is -- your own \\"last chance to see\\" (or, rather, read) him.  His own voice, his own words, his own experiences.  For me, it was a fond farewell from an old friend I'd never met, who, from his new home -- far beyond life, the universe, and everything -- telling me, \\"Yes, I'm dead. But there are still a few rhinos and gorillas and dolphins that aren't. Do me a favor; make sure they stay that way.\\"
N I really enjoyed the humor and visual scenes about Botswana in this book.
N ALthough he is correct that the IMF and World Bank can and should play a role, he should also advocate reforming these institutions so that they not only reflect the interest of the dominant capitalist countries. Politics has a role as well, and he must address the inherent contradictions within the Capitalist system that encourages capital accumulation, flight and waste. All in all and interesting read from an \\"insider\\"...if you are looking for alternatives to the \\"Washington Consensus\\" then this is not your book. This book mainly advocates tweeking the international system (IMF, World bank, UN) to help alleviate poverty (which has political as well as economic reasons) but not changing it per se. I would have hoped that he would have taken on more the Capitalist world system and its predictable modern expression of it and its future trajectory.
N The issue with opinion like his is that atheism is easy. IN complete arrogance any 8th grader can clearly refute the possibilites of the scriptures using 8th grade science! <br /> <br />What Earl misses is the basis for all believers.  <br /> <br />                      \\"Faith\\" <br /> <br />Scientists have no faith seeking earthy proof. The ultimate arrogance is the man who can refute the smallest evidance of something he does not understand. Something that requires \\"faith\\" above all.  <br /> <br />Without faith this book is just as moot as the book by Sobel. Without faith. Neither is relavant. <br /> <br />Tom B
N If you like the story that has been happening up until now, you will like this book. <br /> <br />If you want to give this series a shot, go for it.  It is the best story around.  It is a little lengthy and detailed, but that does not make it bad, just precise. <br /> <br />Look at the haters to see what type of people don't like this book or series.  Most haven't read this book or some of the others.  People should not be bitter at the author for doing what he wants to do.  If someone doesn't like it they should go red something else instead of crying about it.
N I picked this book up as it was the same edition that the local Vo-tech uses to teach their courses.  The amazon price was the least expensive.  The book is complete and comes with self evaluation software to see if one is ready for the A+ exam.  It is no substitute for actually training but I think a self motivated \\"techy\\" might be able to pass the A+ with this book alone.
N In a not too distant future, Angel is a certified Retribution Specialist (CRS), which means that when the law fails to bring justice, the victims can hire a CRS to bring in the perpetrator of the crime to them to enact their own justice.  When a closed case is reopened, Angel is again under investigation for \\"what happened\\" the night policeman Danny Black died.  On top of dealing with this, her mother, Lola, gets kidnapped, and Angel knows that if she doesn't rescue Lola herself, she might die. <br /> <br />Because she has Detective Marco following her and questioning her movements - from the past as well as during the events he witnesses personally, she starts finding things out about herself she really didn't want to know...like her exceptionally good luck.  It may not be luck after all; the physic abilities Lola has may actually be genuine and she inherited them.  <br /> <br />KISS OF THE BLUE DRAGON is the second story I've read by Julie Beard, and I actually like her writing style better here.  The story is written in first person, which can drive readers batty (me too upon occasion); however, it works here.  There is a different \\"feel\\" to KISS completely.  For me, I can \\"hear\\" a narrator filling in the details of Angels' activities.  So even though we, as a reader, only get to know her thoughts and impressions of what she sees, we still get to know what is going on around her.  You get to know Angel, what motivates her and see how she thinks very well.  I also really liked the fact that a lot of simple details of her life are included. <br />  <br />I will admit it was a close call as to whether I would like Angel or not.  She almost doesn't seem feminine.  However, if you read a little further into the book, you learn what her logic is, how she thinks but more importantly WHY.  Angel is tough, spunky, kick-butt heroine and out to help those unable to help themselves.  She is fearless and makes her decisions based on what is right rather than whether she willget hurt or not.  Angel is one busy lady.  She has cases that she maintains during the process of rescuing Lola and I liked the fact that Julie Beard didn't drop some of these issues, therefore the story stays three dimensional.   <br /> <br />While the reopened investigation is secondary to what is going on in her life, it is what brings our hero and heroine together.  I was happy with the chemistry between her and Detective Marco even if the bedroom scenes take place off of the books pages.   <br /> <br />I like the fact that even though KISS is a science-fiction romance, the author doesn't go out of her way to create objects that will stump the reader, or throw off the flow of the novel.  For an example: in a time where DNA left behind is what would keep you in jail, rather than using a hollow-tip bullet, a criminal would use a bullet filled with acid therefore destroying the evidence.   <br /> <br />KISS is technically supposed to be a romance, but with the way this story ends, we don't have our heroine hooking up with the hero.  Because Lola was kidnapped by one of the Chicago mobs there are still some unresolved issues that its sequel might wrap up.  Regardless, I didn't feel like major details were left out or the story wasn't well developed.  As a reader I didn't find myself wondering, \\"what just happened\\"?   <br /> <br />I found KISS OF THE BLUE DRAGON very interesting, and look forward to reading the further adventures of Angel in its sequel TOUCH OF THE WHITE TIGER.  So, if you are looking for something a little different, check out this story!
Y National Geographic Traveler is the best series of its type, and the NGT Thailand book has the same standards of quality as all the others.  It provides an excellent mix of written descriptions and beautiful pictures, both of which are helpful in determining whether to include places on your trip itinerary.  The only flaw is that the hotel and meal section is not particularly useful.
N My assumption is that a DK Eyewitness Book entitled \\"Aztec, Inca & Maya\\" would devote sections to each of the three great civilizations that Spanish explorers encountered and eradicated in the 16th century.  The Aztec empire stretched between the Pacific and the Atlantic costs of Mesoamerica, the Maya kingdom was found in the eastern part of Mesoamerica, and the Inca Empire stretched 4,000 miles along the western coast of South America.  But this book considers the people of these regions to be a mosaic of tribes and nations so that most of the chapters are topical, talking about food and drink, religious life, masks, and such in terms of all of the cultures that apply.  There are a few specific chapters devoted to the Incas and their ancestors and Cities of the Andes, but most toss in everything together.<br /><br />I have to admit, I do not find this approach to work anymore than one about Mediterranean cultures that lumps Spain, Italy and Greece together with the likes of Portugal, Sicily, and Crete thrown in for good measure.  In this volume the Olmecs, Teotihuacans, and Toltecs are thrown in for good measure, but not so that you can have anything close to a clear conception of the specific cultures.  There are some topics where it makes sense to talk about multiple cultures, such as the Human sacrifice by the Incas and Aztecs, but that does not apply to all of these topics.  Consequently, I am tempted to get different colored highlighters and color code the three main cultures throughout the book so it is easier to make the connections.<br /><br />As always, the chief attraction of this Eyewitness Book is that it is filled with photographs of artifacts from museums around the world, from the Archaeological Museum in Lima the National Palace in Mexico City to the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale in Florence and the Rietberg Museum in Zurich (a subtle reminder that a lot of New World treasures made their way to Europe).  Most of us will never get to see a Toltec coyote warrior inlaid with mother-of-pearl, the Gateway of the Sun at Tiahuanaco, or a \\"teponaztli\\" (horizontal drum) in person.  \\"The Los Angeles Times Book Review\\" called one of these volumes \\"Like a mini-museum between the covers of a book,\\" which is so on point that DK always puts that quote on the back.  Almost as important, Elizabeth Bauedano provides detailed captions for the illustrations so that you know what you are looking at and what it means.  Consequently \\"Aztec, Inca & Maya\\" works better as a supplemental source than as an introduction to these fascinating civilizations.nlaid with mother-of-pearl, the Gateway of the Sun at Tiahuanaco, or a \\"teponaztli\\" (horizontal drum) in person.  \\"The Los Angeles Times Book Review\\" called one of these volumes \\"Like a mini-museum between the covers of a book,\\" which is so on point that DK always puts that quote on the back.

N Isabella Zophie & Le Cirque de Magique is an excellent book. I would say that it is one of the best books that I have ever read. It is very exciting and I enjoyed the mystery that was in the story. This is one of the most adventurous books that I have ever read.  <br /> <br />This book is about a ten year old girl, Isabella Zophie, who finds the Locket of Fire and Water in her great aunt's house and when she puts it on she is transported to another world - Zartarbia. She meets a circus which has lots of great characters including Mr Krock O'Dile who is a crocodile that runs the circus.  Isabella is chased by one of the syndicate, Mistress Sectica.  The Syndicate are a group of villains who are trying to control Zartarbia.  Fighting against the syndicate is the Federation Against Dark Forces (FADF) with agents trained in some of the coolest fighting techniques.   <br /> <br />Zartarbia is a magical world where nothing is as it seems. There is a crazy character called the Thinker who is a complete lunatic and very funny.  The first chapter is a bit confusing but you need to keep reading as it is important for later in the book.  <br /> <br />I think that all genders will like this book. Some parts in this book are very funny. If you are interested in fantasy and adventure, then you will enjoy this book.  <br /> <br />I would recommend this book to anyone.  <br />
N All of these books rock!!!  I love them soooo much, I really wish a number seven would come out!!!!
N Being new to Sharepoint and webparts, I found this book to be concise and to-the-point. Guides you through basic webpart development in C# (when you register the book you can get code in VB if you desire). The book also discusses in straightforward terms debugging, deployment of webparts, code access security, targeting audiences and personalizing content. Plus it is only 175 pages, so it won't collapse your bookshelf.
N First,  the author is not a \\"cad\\".  He is too ugly and broke to be able to seduce women and leave them feeling used.  I got this book from the library because as a single gal I thought that I would learn something about men,  the kind who charm,  seduce,  and destroy.  Well,  what I learned is that Rick Marin is just a talentless guy trying to pass himself off as an intropesctive writer-wannabe poser.  It's amazing that Marin got any girls to date him taking into consideration how cold and judgmental he is. Reading his book was like watching a car accident--you know it's better to control yourself but you keeping looking to see the blood and guts.  Well,  this book just shows that this guy,  who has really nothing special,  or even redeemable,  is striving to be funny, intellectual, and show the male perspective on dating. He comes off really shallow,  superficial,  and as though he doesn't care which girl he's with as long as he's not alone.  Read it for yourself--Marin has nothing new or interesting to write. In this day and age,  anyone can publish regardless of whether or not the writer has anything significant to write about.
N Simple and easy to understand. I wish the book would have gone into a little more detail but I found that detail in the HR 25 website. <br />Boortz and Linder did a good job laying out the positive and the negatives in this book. I will not diatribe about my personal politics has you have probably noticed with most of these posts. Read the book and make up your own mind. Write your newspaper with your political thoughts and write your review of the BOOK here. <br />
N In Goodbye Doesn't Mean Forever, Lurlene McDaniel tells a heart-felt story of a teenage girl who is struggling with cancer. <br /> Melissa finds out early in the story that her leukemia, which has been in remission for two years has relapsed. Jory, Melissa's best friend promises to help her have the best senior year ever, because of all the stress and pain in Melissa's life. Melissa's older brother, Michael, who is also Jory's life long crush, is asked to donate bone marrow to Melissa, because that is her only hope. Soon after, Melissa becomes well and in a couple of days, the doctors say she will be able to go home. Jory goes to visit her two days later, only to find that Melissa has caught a fever and that her body is rejecting the bone marrow. At school, a boy named Lyle tries to help Jory with all the sorrow of her sick friend. Eventually, Jory falls in love with Lyle, but still has feelings for Michael. Will Jory find true love? Will Melissa overcome cancer? To find out, read Goodbye Doesn't Mean Forever. <br /> I highly recommend this book to any girl ages 12-112 that enjoys romance and drama novels. It is an amazing book and I promise that if you read it, you won't be disappointed.  <br /> <br />
N Grant and Twain is a good book, informative, insightful, and concise enough.  <br /> <br />Mark Perry starts by giving us very good sketches of the lives of the two principals up to the point of the story, including some surprising (for me) details about their personal lives.  He then goes into their relationship, how it came to be, and the affect it had on their great works of literature. The books influenced by their time together, Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and Grant's Personal Memoirs, are considered to be classics and the best that either of the authors ever produced.  In fact, some think that Huckleberry Finn is the best American novel ever, and that Personal Memoirs (about the Mexican and Civil Wars) is the best American book ever written on military events.   Perry records many conversations Grant and Twain had with each other and with the other folks surrounding them, including families and associates.  It makes you feel like you are there, and gives some personal insight into what these gentlemen were really like. We find that they were both quite remarkable as private figures as well as public figures. The story of their relationship rides to a great extent on the heroic drama of Grant racing to finish his book before dying of cancer, to ensure the financial security of his family.  Perry, at the same time, paints a fascinating sketch of what Twain called the Gilded Age, a time of great industrial progress along with great corruption in the U.S. <br /> <br />It was a thoroughly enjoyable read. <br />
N \\"Truth vs Falsehood\\" is Hawkins' 4th book. In my mind, it is his greatest gift yet, but not in the sense that one might think. This will be explained in the closing. I will also preface by saying that I am in no way political. Truth is all that I am interested in. <br />   In Hawkins' previous 3 books, the kinesiological response was portrayed as infallible. His language was very absolute in its tone, giving the technique more credibility than it has ever received. Being so absolute with one's tone was the first obvious clue. When one becomes absolute in their tone, they often put an inordinate amount of faith in something outside themselves and overlook the inherent limitations. This is true for everything from religious absolutism to the mythical cure-all in medicine. The person who uses the absolute tone acts as if your salvation lies with this one particular thing.  <br />   I am a traditional naturopath. I was using kinesiology before Hawkins' books, and I am closely connected to practitioners of kinesiology who've used it in excess of 20 years. An observant and curious practitioner quickly realizes that the intent of both the testee and tester influences response. In some cases, a strong-willed practitioner who thinks he knows the cause of imbalance or dis-ease is affecting testee response and in essence using kinesiology to validate his own opinions and beliefs, albeit unknowingly. He will get the positive response he desires, whereas the practitioner with no vested interest in anything except the truth will get a different response on the same testee.  <br />   It has been difficult for me to bridge the gap between Hawkins' theory/ doctoral thesis on his use of kinesiology and the understanding that most experienced practitioners of kinesiology have. Nearly all experienced practitioners simply don't find the technique to be infallible. Certain criteria must be met for accurate response. Those criteria are training, impartiality, and the sincere and humble desire to put absolute truth above all things. Truth is absolute, but the technique is not. Remaining neutral is an ongoing challenge for the practitioner. <br /> <br />   I am not familiar with the testing methods used for Hawkins' doctoral thesis \\"Quantitative and Qualitative Calibration of the Levels of Consciousness\\". However, for it to withstand any scientific scrutiny, both the tester and testee would have to be without any knowledge on the subject matter. There would also have to be at least 20 different testers for the 3000+ test subjects, with each tester coming up with their own test responses to a given list of questions. Responses would not be compared until all testers have compiled their findings. For his thesis, something along these lines was most likely used.  <br />   Throughout \\"Power vs. Force\\", a healthy skepticism was maintained towards Hawkins putting so much faith in this technique. Part of this was based on an inability to get the same responses he was getting. The information presented in \\"The Eye of the I\\" and \\"I\\" was absolutely astounding, and skepticism was temporarily set aside. Apparently, his intent was pure and sincere enough to allow him to experience absolute truth on spiritual inquiry. Much of this can be attributed to his description of a life-changing experience. He was atheist (or possibly agnostic... don't remember which), hit a major crisis in his life, and finally called out in total humility to be shown the truth of God. I feel his pure intent allowed him to access the truth he did. <br />   However, once Hawkins gained confidence in the technique, he apparently fell into the trap of thinking he could divorce himself from influencing response. The methods used for gleaning the information found in \\"Truth vs Falsehood\\" would surely not withstand any scientific scrutiny. The simple fact that the subject matter was familiar to the tester(s) and testee(s) disqualifies it. Asking about the nature of life, death, and other unknown spiritual matters is not the same as asking about one's perceived reality, which one already has strong opinions and emotions about and attachments to. Both testers and testees would have to be completely unfamiliar with the line of inquiry to have any guarantee of neutrality. <br /> <br />   Within 30 seconds of opening \\"Truth vs Falsehood\\", it was clear something wasn't right. Hawkins' 3 previous books have helped us to discern truth from falsehood more clearly. Many of us have reached a place where now we `just know' the truth. It is often a clear gut feeling, and at that point the kinesiological response seems unnecessary. In a way, it turns out the technique was only a tool to guide us to our own inner knowing.  <br />   Hawkins acknowledges the existence of ignorance and untruth, but does not address the issue of deliberate deception. It is ironic that after years of devotion to the truth, Hawkins still does not fully grasp the nature of deception. The world citizenry is currently experiencing one of the most elaborate mass brainwashes in history.  <br />   In fact, Hawkins even engages in deception when he explains the Iraq situation. He indicates that the primary reason to be there is to protect the world's (and specifically America's) economic and oil interests. Yet the primary reason given to the public for going to war was weapons of mass destruction. Whether or not it was a fact that there were actually WMDs misses the point. It was given as the main reason, and it was not. That is deception. For Hawkins to agree with the idea of justifiable deceptions is a clear indicator that he is not neutral here. <br />   More importantly, for Hawkins to act as if outright deception is not occurring speaks to one's ability to deal with reality. For a person with 80 years of conditioned perception of reality to have reality turned on its head, a person could have a serious breakdown. <br /> <br />   The gift in this 4th book is that Hawkins has shown us what thekinesiological technique can and cannot be used for. It can be used by the sincere truthseeker for his/herself. However, it is not to be used to show one a reality they are not ready to see. There is no technique to make one see the truth. One's clear and sincere intention is all that can do that. And even then, one may not be ready to handle the fullness of reality. The process of how one \\"wakes up\\" is yet to be known. <br />   Who better than Hawkins to show us that experience is no substitute for impartiality? So, the readers of his 4th book get the opportunity to discern what is truth and what is his belief. The first 3 books prepared us, and the 4th is the test. Although he didn't intend it to work this way, it is the greatest gift of all. And just as importantly, it shows us that one can be quite enlightened in one area, while not having it all together in another. Even when one crosses the 600 line, one is still assailed by falsity and ignorance and must be constantly vigilant and unattached to one's beliefs.  <br /> <br />   And realistically, it couldn't have happened any other way. Given Hawkins' first 3 books and his audience, if he gave us the absolute truth about all the deceptions that make up the current perceived reality, it could have seriously messed some people up. It could result in serious mental breakdown if it was said that there aren't actually arab terrorists creating terror in America. So, the book had to be presented this way. And those of us who know the real truth know it through our own inner knowing already and don't need Hawkins to tell us. <br />   In `The Art of War', Sun Tzu said, \\"All warfare is based on deception.\\" Well, currently we have warfare in nearly every form. Even `necessary' and `justified' wars have deception as their roots. <br /> <br />Michael <br />Santa Fe, New Mexico
N In Three Creeks, Manitoba Emily Moore is worried about her septuagenarian neighbor and friend Daniel Rutherford, who she has not heard from in a week and who missed a wedding in which the entire town showed up.  She visits his property to learn he has been gone for about a week.  Inside his dying plants show he has not been there.<br /><br />Worse a stranger is residing in Daniel's house insisting that he is a nephew interested in his family tree.  However, as the residences on Creek Road suffer a rash of odd break-ins, Emily notices that Matthew is paying more attention to her and her parents than the Rutherford family.  Emily wonders is he really a relative of her neighbor or is he the B&E bandit?  Regardless, she knows from the moment their eyes saw one another, something inside her heart clicked.<br /><br />The sequel to THE HOUSE ON CREEK ROAD is a fine romantic suspense thriller as Emily wonders whether her heart has betrayed her since the stranger seems to be \\"investigating\\" her family not his as he claims.  Matthew finds the conflict of interest even more difficult as he hides why he is in town from the woman he has fallen in love with though they hardly know one another.  The romance is perhaps too fast yet seems right as it adds conflict between the two wannabe lovers.  Fans will want to travel down THE WINTER ROAD.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
N Just want to clarify how to  use the Emanuel Contracts book:<br /><br />I recommend it as a semester-long guide. This will help you flesh out the varied topics and clarify them as you are reading your casebook. This book recommends reading your casebook first, then referring to the same topics in this volume to ensure you understand the material--this should be done before you encounter the material in class, preferably.<br /><br />If you're looking for something to pick up midway during the semester or just before finals, I think the Crunchtime series by the same publisher is a better choice.
N I enjoyed the comments of the preceding which told me much about the book in my conteplation of purchasing it. Lucent's down fall started with the 1984 decree. Something that AT&T embraced thinking that new and bigger markets would be available. Missteps included buying TCI cable without the experience and knowledge of running a mom and pop business on the run far from \\"Bell Standards\\" that so many Western Electric and Lucent Managers embraced. They did not change into the flexible and savy business men of the 80s and 90s and lost at every turn and decission. The \\"Early Outs\\" prior to 1991 took most of the business knowledge and stability with them. Managers and CEOs were hired from all differnt kinds of Companies having differnt values and business understandings (which was needed) but lacked fundamental telecommunications expertise and how to gain a lion's share of the market. The best method was new technologies coupled with listening to all the customers needs and concerns. Lucent, like its predecessor and parent company, devalued it's stock and undevalued it's once talented, dedicated and loyal workforce. The Book seems like a good purchase but it doesn't seem to touch upon the employees who built it and subsequently were forced to see it go. Bell Labs and the Bell System literally dictated to the Baby Bells that analog equipment would continue to be used in the late 70s. Digital technology had been introduced by various venders and Bell Labs played \\"catch up\\" when the operating companies began buying the digital equipment fron non Western Electric sources. That was the first mis-step of Western Electric....Lucent Technologies management. Understand the marketplace and the needs of your customer...always. R. Ferry...27 years with Western Electric.
Y It is to Jane Hyun's credit to discuss issues of Asian American professionals on a very practical level. There are however, some caveats for the reader. The book needs to be contextualized within a larger conceptual framework. The overarching issues are ignored within her practical framework, namely: Who needs to change? Who needs to accommodate whom?  How much? What are the risks and benefits? Her book appears to be saying that corporate America needs to understand Asians, but it does not need to change.  Rather it is the Asian professional that needs to change and adapt. <br /> <br />Is the book too heavily assimilationist?  It is not clear as Hyun does make a distinction early in her book between assimilation (\\"adopting ...at the expense of one's own cultural characteristics\\") and acculturation (\\"adapting ...while continuing to maintain values, perspectives, and features of one's native culture\\"). <br /> <br />There appears to be little adaptation of any Asian models or perspective to the mainstream USA corporate culture -- page 279 suggests two ways: \\"Develop cultural competency\\" and \\"Make use of your bicultural and bilingual abilities.\\" While recognizing the dominance of USA/Western research and models in the business world, it is also logical and no \\"one model fits all.\\" Perhaps future research and practices can provide indigenous Asian models or perspectives that can be adapted and work effectively in coporate America or other cultures.  The Special Issue on China & India (Business Week, August 22/29, 2005) points out how some USA business models are not applicable. <br /> <br />It is not an either/or proposition.  By utilizing the juxtaposition of the Asian behavior/values system versus the Western behavior/values system to present her central thesis, Hyun creates a false dichotomy in the mind of the reader. Current business literature is filled with exhortations of \\"win/win,\\" \\"both/and,\\" \\"alignment,\\" and \\"interdependence\\" -- all very Asian concepts. These traditional Asian cultural values are at the very heart of what contemporary corporate America is trying to effect in order to add value. So there is a \\"baby with the bath water\\" caveat here to the reader.  The accommodation needs to be reciprocal, not unilateral. <br /> <br />In her Epilogue, Hyun encourages the reader to \\"Develop an Action Plan That Works with Your Persona.\\"  It seems throughout her book that the emphasis is on asking the reader to tailor his or her persona to that which is required for success in corporate America, not on utilizing the behavioral strengths and cognitive positions with which someone who comes with a strong Asian cultural background is imbued.  Being Asian -- it seems to Hyun -- puts one in a deficit position. <br /> <br />The reader needs to be cautious in the self-assessment, individual profiles, exercises and tools cited. They yield helpful descriptive self-awareness profiles and information, not diagnostic or predictive profiles, and they are dependent on situational factors. There are many suggestions, based perhaps on many years of experience, but empirical data demonstrating their reliability, validity or efficacy are not mentioned. <br /> <br />Kudos to Hyun for encouraging the seeking of regular and frequent performance feedback. This is a career self-monitoring technique that is utilized far too little by all employees to help document and strengthen requests for job and salary advancement.  In spite of the conceptual conundrums, this highly practical book is a must read. <br /> <br />Adrian Chan (Kochman Mavrelis Associates, Oak Park, IL) & Barry Mar (Management & Resources Associates, Seattle, WA) <br />
N Dobson begins her easy-to-read book with chapters appropriately titled \\"Helping Your Child Love Learning\\" and \\"Creating Your Own Educational Reform\\". After reading just these two chapters I was already in love with the book.<br /><br />The remaining chapters consist of reader contributed ideas, lessons and games. These parents know how to make education so fun the kids probably won't even know they are learning! The ideas are easy, fast, inexpensive, and usually involve minimal research.<br /><br />What really makes this book stand far and above others is Table 2.2, found on pages 34-37. This helpful table lists many popular off-the-shelf curriculums that can be easily recreated at home with materials you already have, or can be found used - all for under $100!<br /><br />This book is truly ingenious! It's about time someone organized the ideas of creative parents into one handy reference. I cannot think of a better person to present this material other a personal favorite, Linda Dobson.
N This book is famous for its unique method. It attempts to establish what Hitler knew and when he knew it. In effect, it is written from Hitler's point of view. The events are narrated in the order Hitler experienced them, and as he experienced them. Thus one gets a vivid feeling of being present as history unfolds, an experience stolen by \\"omiscient\\" historians and biographers. Of course Irving also includes a huge amount of information gleaned from sometimes exclusive interviews with witnesses and participants. This book has been controversial since it first appeared in the 1970s. It has been publicly criticized by many historians. But it has also been tacitly praised by them, insoar as they have borrowed heavily from Irving's research.
N Beatifully written, moving and very original love story - with additional twists of philosophy and time traveling. For me, the most interesting part of the book was its alternative approach to time travel - something like living many lives simultaneosly, rather than traditional \\"what if\\" approach. Made me wonder - and think.
N I read this book mulitiple times. The way Card writes his characters as living breathing beings is wonderful. He doesn't just slap together a one dimensional character. The story moves rather slowly, but once you truly emerse yourself, it picks up. I was very shocked by the ending, but was overall pleased with the story and plotline. It isn't a happy story where everyone lives happily ever after, but then life isn't like that either.
N I started the series with Winter House and am now back tracking to the beginning.  I enjoyed this book as much as Winter House and can't wait to start the next one in the series.
N I've read almost every book written on the Beatles and found Cynthia's story poignant and from the heart.  She's had a hard time finding her true self in the shadows of her larger-than-life men and marriages and she persists despite the setbacks and enjoys the adventures. <br /> <br />The first half of the book is almost identical to her earlier book, Twist of Lennon in 1989.  I've not read much about her or Julian from 1980 on and it is interesting to look at behind-the-scenes reflections vs. what the public sees.  Julian: Sing again in your own key and forget about Them. <br /> <br />If you are a '42-years And Counting' Beatles fan like me, then  you will enjoy this book.  There are some unreleased pictues you'll relish from Cyn's family album. <br /> <br />All You Need Is Love, oh yeah, yet there wuz a lot of hurtin' souls along Penny Lane besides Eleanor Rigby or Sgt. Pepper. The price of fame which is not fleeting here. <br /> <br />Donna Coulson
N I read this book 5 years ago when I was preparing to go to Boot Camp.  I'm now out of the Corps after serving my four years and am proud to be a Marine.  I don't remember the book too well specifically.  But I do remember that it let me know what to expect in Boot Camp.  Coming in I had a better idea of what it would be like, and so it was advantageous.  Although no one can know what it is truly like without actually going, this is a pretty good discription.  It does seem kind of censored with what I know really happens at PI.  But that's good, we don't need \\"mothers of america\\" watering down our training any more than they already have.  They don't need to know. <br /> <br />Semper Fi
N I have searched and searched for a great Arthurian retelling and have been disappointed with the ones I have ventured into reading. I was somewhat skeptical when I picked up Nancy McKenzie's Queen of Camelot. This two-novels-in-one compilation is based on Guenevere, from her point of view, in first person narrative, and is 623 pages long in very small print. I didn't want to waste my time reading something this big only to be disappointed at the end. I nevertheless gave the book a whirl. Glad I did! This is one of the most compelling and beautifully told retells I have ever read! McKenzie gives us a detailed story about Guenevere from her point of view. She tells us about the prophecy on the day she was born, how she spends her childhood as an adventurous tomboy, how people fear her and treat her differently as she grows up, how the knights around her battle with the Saxons, and how all of the prophecies come true. She meets Arthur, marries him and later has a love affair with Lancelot, something based on the original tale. But the novel has so much more than that. You will see how this story of magic, prophecies, love and betrayal transpires in an altered, detailed and beautiful light. There are many twists throughout the novel.<br /><br />Guenevere is developed in such an abundant, three-dimensional way in this novel. She is no longer just the pagan beauty who marries a Christian, betrays him and destroys all of Camelot as a result. She is a complex character with flaws as well as virtues in this offering. Arthur is also written in a more interesting, compelling way here, but it is Lancelot that once again blows me away. I have always romanticized Sir Lancelot and McKenzie does not disappoint me in her version of the loyal, chivalrous knight. Merlin and Morgan Le Fay are written with much complexity and nuance as well. This novel, however, does not focus so much on the love triangle between Guenevere, Arthur and Lancelot as much as her inability to supply an heir for Arthur and her affection for Arthur's bastard son, the traitorous Mordred. The overall story is magnificent. Once again, I say that McKenzie did a wonderful job bringing Guenevere to life. She turns this character into a strong, intelligent, complex, three-dimensional, flesh and blood woman, someone you will feel a great deal of affinity with. She is not portrayed as a simple-minded, traitorous hussy in this one! I loved the fanciful storytelling style that made me turn the pages until the wee hours of the night. Some of my friends who read the book along with me complained about it being too long-winded. I didn't think it was long-winded at all. In fact, I wish it had been longer. I loved this book and I look forward to giving Grail Prince a whirl.for Arthur and her affection for Arthur's bastard son, the traitorous Mordred. The overall story is magnificent.

N This book is great! Written as seen by one of the characters of the book keeps you intrigued throughout the whole book. Michael Frederick is a great author, that honest, brutal, poignant, and doesn't skirt the issue. Wish more books were written this way.
N This author will be on the Coast2Coast radio show tonight 10/13/05 at 10PM PT. I will do a review at that time. Yes, I've read the book, but I need to ask him some questions before I rate this one folks. This is one of those books that will stir you up, make you ask questions, and allow you to accept the answers. My review will be posted after the George Noory interview...
N By the time we get to \\"Guardsman of Gor,\\" the 15th of John Norman's Counter-Earth novels, we are clearly in a transitional period.  I did not like the idea that instead of Tarl Cabot we were now telling the story of a different Earth man who ends up on Gor, although the Jason Marshall trilogy was more interesting to me than the story of Judy Thornton, a woman brought to Gor as a captive in \\"Slave Girl of Gor.\\"  In the first volume of the trilogy, \\"Fighting Slave of Gor,\\" Marshall ends up on Gor when he tries to save Beverly Henderson from a Gorean slave trap.  The next thing the civilized Earth man knows he is a slave on Gor.  Starting out as the silk slave of the Lady Florence of Vonda, Marshall then becomes a Gorean gladiator, which gives him the opportunity to become free so that he can find Beverly, who now also a slave on Gor.<br /><br />\\"Rogue of Gor\\" is the middle volume in the trilogy and the novel and has Marshall searching for Beverly.  But since this is a trilogy you know that he is not going to find her until the final volume, \\"Guardsman of Gor.\\"  Instead, Marshall travels along the River Vosk to the port city of Victoria, north of Port Kar, and finds himself in the middle of a war between Glorious Ar and the Salerian Confederation as the pirate fleet seeks to control the waterways of Gor on which the cities are so dependent.  In terms of providing more action than sex, this is the one volume of the trilogy that delivers on that score and if you are waiting for Jason and Beverly to consummate their relationship in Gorean terms you have the last half of the next novel for all of that to play out (after a giant naval battle).  In this one he finds her on the slaver's block, buys her, and sets her free even though she insists she is a true slave and therefore does not desire freedom.<br /><br />There is a sense in which Norman is trying to get back to the basics, since the fight between Ar and the Salerian Confederation is not, at face value, part of the gigantic struggle between the Priest-Kings and the Kurii.  But the sexual philosophy of Gor is now becoming the dominant theme of Norman's stories.  The back of the original paperback declares, \\"Jason Marshall learned the meaning of manhood and the power of women, both dominant and submissive\\" on Gor, but clearly he has yet to fully accept his role in this society.  This time around Norman is educating a male rather than a female, which is usually the case in the Gor novels, and I think that you have to take such instruction at face value.<br /><br />The obvious assumption might be that most men would not need to be persuaded to live a life being a master, but when you consider the discussion that Jason and Beverly were having at the start of the trilogy before they ended up on Gor you have to admit that it is not exactly the sort of lifestyle to which a \\"civilized\\" man would aspire.  Clearly Norman is arguing men have to be carefully taught such beliefs almost as much as women, although you will never convince me the male of the species would require as much persuasion.  Consequently, whether you judge \\"Rogue of Gor\\" by the standard of either the best Gor adventures (\\"Nomads of Gor\\" and \\"Assassins of Gor\\") or the main testaments of Gorean sexuality (\\"Slave Girl of Gor,\\" \\"Kajira of Gor,\\" and \\"Dancing Girl of Gor\\"), it falls short.

N Prior to reading this book, I didn't think I had major limiting beliefs but the exercises that Cole-Whittaker takes you through helped me uncover some I hadn't even realized I had. <br /> <br />If something has kept you from reaching your potential and you can't quite figure out what, pick up this book and uncover your personal obstacles. <br /> <br />Cole-Whittaker is a minister and does refer to God often in the book. If that bothers you, try to figure out a way to get around the references because this book may do wonders for you. I personally subscribe to the Higher Power so it was fine with me.
N When I first received the book, I was a little disappointed. For an expensive book, it's very thin and has large print, which makes it look like a children's book.  <br />   However, the artwork is absolutely beautiful! Most of the myths in it are ones that I haven't read anywhere else. It also divides the myths into seperate eras - ex The Stone Age, The Iron Age, etc.
N Covers only the first beta of Sql 2005.  Many examples don't work.  Talks about features not in the product or that work very differently.  Also not written for developers.  I agree with the other review--it really is for beginners only.
N Everything I have tried in this book is delicious, even when the ingredients aren't 100% fresh from Nantucket.  The are easy and simple to prepare as well.
N It's not a propriate bood for beginer to study NMR knowledge, but good for teachers to prepare class teaching materials.
N All around, Dove was a pretty good book. It was basically about this sixteen year old boy who loves boats. He takes a trip around the world to see what people and their different cultures are like. Even though he was in love with sailing, he did not really know the dangerous things that could happen to him while he was on his adventure. The protagonist of the story is obviously the boy(Robin Graham, because he was the main character. For the theme of this story, I would say that \\" Dont judge a book by its cover\\", would be one that makes a lot of sense. Another book that I would also reccomend would be Maiden Voyage, by Tania Aebi. This is what I thought about the book \\" Dove.\\" Once again, it was a great read.
N Terry McMillan's characters are real, alive and easy to relate to. I appreciate her writing because it speaks to your heart and helps you understand yourself and others. This book is a must read because it is not filled with flashy clichs but still grabs and keeps your attention until the very end. But It!
N very informative on various aspects of astrology ranging from generalities about signs to history of the signs. i was highly interesting and is a great informative tool for a light reading of your sign and a more extensive one.
N I was hoping that the book would be better than the television show, and it wasn't. The show, with its amusing quips, puns and overreaching pseudointellectual analyses of female behavior, is entertaining in a vegetative sort of way. The book should have had more depth. Yes, I'm sure there are women in NYC who claim to be looking for love as they hop from bed to bed hoping to change men into what they want. I hope to high Heaven that the denizens of real NYC are nothing like the flaky women in Candace Bushnell's Sex In The City. Mr. Big is just as egregious in the book as he's portrayed in the HBO show. On the plus side, Patricial Field does a great job with Carrie's wardrobe on the show.
Y Champlin bravely asserts his own contribution to the great wealth of Neronian scholarship for the critics to pick apart. I find very little to quibble about.<br />It is difficult to write even-handedly about Nero for a Western audience. Who could forget the image of a man who \\"fiddled while Rome burned\\" or the terrible tyrant who had begun a nearly 170 year \\"persecution\\" of the early Christians, under whose reign both Peter and Paul were executed? As other reviewer comments reveal, you can easily earn the brand of a Nero \\"apologist\\" if you don't tow the party line, however inaccurate it might be.<br /><br />Champlin's thesis can be stated simply as follows: many, if not most of Nero's grandstands and outrageous actions, were performed out of considerable political shrewdness and calculation - not the madness or puerile excess wrongly attributed to a \\"live fast, die young, and leave a good looking corpse\\" emperor. Nero's success, Champlin argues in the first chapter, is evinced by a shockingly prolonged \\"afterlife\\" manifested in pseudo-Neros, Judeo-Christian apocalyptic writings, and a disenfranchised populace openly lamenting his death. Nonetheless, I cannot help but wonder, (working on the same assumption,) whether he had truly orchestrated his public relations as well as Champlin suggests given his untimely demise at age 30.<br /><br />Some reviewers disagree, but I reckon Champlin's original Nero-Periander link to be one of the most intriguing ideas in ancient biography I've ever seen. The ambivalent relationship with the mother, the Philhellenism, the artistic bent, and the numerous other links are too compelling to ignore outright, even if the conclusion a hard sell. Further research is warranted, but I suspect that Champlin, with his great intellect and energy, may have already exhausted all of the available evidence for advancing his thesis. He demonstrates the Augustus/Antony connections thoroughly. The discussion of the great fire of 64 is arrestingly well done: after convincingly presenting the defense for Nero's innocence, he suddenly shatters the deception in stating that despite this preceding evidence, Nero undoubtedly held direct responsibility for the coflagration. It hits you with dramatic effect almost equal to one of the primary sources comprising the centerpiece of his proof in this sudden reversal: Tacitus' Annales XV.67.<br /><br />Champlin's organization is somewhat bothersome as it is in \\"Final Judgments,\\" because he rejects chronological arrangement for thematic foci. This requires repetition of several facts, and I cannot understand his reasons for the chapter order. The post-mortem legacy of Nero, being most fascinating, he puts up front obviously to hook his reader. It serves as an interesting set piece for further discourse, because the inevitable wonder we feel about Nero's impression on the world ever after demands explanation: thus the rest of the book. But with Dio, Suetonius, and Tacitus unfolding the bulk of their own histories so methodically, the rearrangement isn't always a neat fit. Still, Champlin's brilliant weaving together of hundreds of sources, as before, vindicates his literary decisions several times over.<br /><br />Champlin, like any other historian, has his hypotheses and directs his evidence toward proving them. His presentation however, is replete with past scholarship and primary sources presented candidly and fairly. One of the most appreciable inclusions is the extensive collection of Latin graffiti, which add a critical dimension to our knowledge. This book has been for me an introduction into full-strength Neronian scholarship and I found it both accessible and empowering enough to read further with confidence.ngly presenting the defense for Nero's innocence, he suddenly shatters the deception in stating that despite this preceding evidence, Nero undoubtedly held direct responsibility for the coflagration.

N While I don't always agree with his TV analysis, I enjoy Mr. Crawford's commentaries. His book, however, is surprisingly shallow and can be summed up in one chapter with footnotes. I didn't realize an intentional misquoting of Thomas Jefferson on page 2 (easy enough to catch as the footnote provides the actual quote) was a foreshadowing of the paraphrasing to come. Almost all his sources are the very media he criticizes.    Yes, the media should be astute and critical of anyone in power anywhere, yet it isn't, mostly because it has been corporatized. vilified and because reporters and organizations have wimped out. OK, yes, and....?     Since Crawford is a journalist, one who claims an inside view of what really goes on, he is obligated by the same standards he poses not just to say this is what went on, but to explain why manipulation is allowed and what to do about it. Tom Fenton in his book, Bad News, does a more thorough job of explaining the links between money and reporting and providing a context for media manipulation and journalistic reticence.     Crawford gives specific examples of manipulation, but doesn't provide motive or context beyond the trite \\"politicians manipulate the media so they can look better so they can become powerful.\\" Therein lies the point, if the media is powerful enough that it needs to be manipulated, then it is powerful enough to hold its own. Why hasn't the media held its own and why aren't people demanding a real public discussion? What does the messenger do with the message he was supposed to deliver?    Crawford says people are tuning to outlets to verify their beliefs so news outlets are becoming customer-driven reinforcing agents. If that's true, why is the media making that choice instead of taking the lead? Politicians do attack the messenger, but often they don't have to, because the messenger has been co-opted. More dangerously, by giving hyperbole public time and space, the news media cuts its own throat then calls it a tracheotomy.    Still, despite the flaws, I stayed with the book's limited scope until page 117. \\"I don't vote....\\" With that, Crawford's credibility flew out the window.     \\"I fear it will make it more difficult to keep my observations down the middle.\\" After 116 pages of caterwalling about professional and personal responsibility, about the consequences to democracy of a media manipulated by power, about how the media is responsible to its constituents, the public, and should judge both the quality and importance of its \\"message,\\" Crawford absolves himself of any duty, responsibility or personal judgment. His book becomes a version of \\"do as I say, not as I do.\\" Worse yet, the core of his argument is a tautology: journalists must give up the rights and responsibilities of citizenship to uphold the rights and responsibilitites of citizenship. Talk about attacking the messenger, the messenger just committed suicide.     Come on, get in the muck with the rest of us, make tough decisions, make judgments. It's in the choosing that one gains perspective and insight. Not voting because you're a journalist is like saying a Yankee fan can't write about baseball or deciding not to eat anything, ever, so no one will know you don't like brocolli.    As Jim Hightower put it, \\"There ain't nothin' in the middle of the road but yellow stripes and dead armadillos.\\"
N This book was written for those who want to learn more about the operation of the daily stock market. The book is definitely not light reading.  Charts and technical aspects abound. If you are a novice, you must actually study the material to fully understand it. This book along with \\"How to make money in stocks\\",and 'The Successful Investor\\" both by O'Neil should be used as text books for anyone who is serious about the stock market
N Mr. Andersons' book provides a thorough examination, diagnosis, and best possible cure for what ails black america. Not poor whites, hispanics, arabs, jews, gays, or white women. You owe it to you and your family to at least check out the facts of this examination and then decide.  <br /> <br />White america has always put their modus operandi in our face; this is our society, these are our rules, do the best you can with what we decide to give you; don't bother me while I make my money. If you do, the police will handle you. <br /> <br />Here is Black americas' call to focus on what should have been the legacy of civil rights - economic empowerment.
N For the operaholics among us (I am one) \\"Fortissimo\\" is an entertaining and interesting look at what goes on backstage at the opera. Author Murray was given unprecedented access to Lyric Opera of Chicago's Opera Center for American Artists during the 2003-2004 season. This is Lyric Opera's training ground for young artists. Murray follows this group of twelve singers through coaching sessions, rehearsals, auditions and performances to give the reader a close-hand look at the rigorous intensity of this most glorious art form. Interspersed with this are chapthers which fill out the picture of what it takes to succeed in opera. There is a chapter devoted to the comprimario - singers who specialize in secondary characters. Another chapter is devoted to Pavarotti, a warning of what can happen when one achieves what Murray dubs 'sacred monster' status. A sacred monster, superstar, Pavarotti was undone at the end of his career by his enormous ego. This book is a wonderful gift for those opera lovers on your Christmas list this season.
N As far as Henry County (and all of central Indiana) ghost stories are concerned, this book is as comprehensive as I've ever seen. I was born and raised in Henry County, and still live here, and I have heard a lot of the stories going around. I've been to a lot of the sites mentioned. Ms. Perry did a wonderful job covering the history, both factual and reported. The grammatics and punctuation leave something to be desired, but it is nothing that hindered my enjoyment of these stories. <br /> <br />
N Learning From The Tanya by Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz is the second volume in the \\"Definitive Commentary on the Moral and Mystical Teaching\\" series focusing on the Kabbalah. The first volume of the series, \\"Opening the Tanya\\" discussed the first section of the original text of Hasidic Master Rabbi Schneur Zalman of Liadi's \\"Tanya\\". This second volume takes on the next major portion of the Tanya, offering the definitive explanation and commentary providing the reader with a guide toward harmony of body and soul, of earthliness and transcendence, and a higher level or awareness and understanding with our human potential with respect to a relationship with God. A scholar, teacher, scientist, author, mystic, and social critic, Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz is a world recognized expert on this subject, and Learning From The Tanya is confidently recommended reading for students of Judaic mysticism and the Kabbalah in general, and the Tanya in particular. <br /> <br />
N I found the story very silly.First: Its not romantic.Second:The heroine is very vain.Three: The language doesn't look like Penny Jordan, it sounded cheap especially when the heroine says baby grub and talkes about her vibrator Roger. <br /> <br />These books are supposed to be silly likable love stories, then of talking about about vibrators etc.   <br /> <br />  <br />
Y This book has been fascinating to read. It is evident, as a student of comparative religion, that the author has done some careful research and integrated it successfully in the book. A lot has to be said for some major research flaws, such as often referring to Sufis (Islamic mystics) and Mosques, even though Islam wasn't to arrive for another 650 years! Overall, it is an entertaining book and will provide you with an interesting alternative for the life of Jesus, an alternative that is likely, not fictional.<br /><br />Enjoy, but do filter the content.
N THe book was good as always and Jim Dale consistently puts the emotion and voices to the book that creates a don't stop listening pleasure. Also a great price at amazon!!!
N Ictor Rudometov and Evgeny Rudometov's PC HARDWARE TUNING & ACCELERATION (1931769230, $39.95) provides a reference programmers will turn to again and again. The most common computer complaint revolves around systems which do not perform to optimal standards: from processors to memory, video adapters, and other hardware, PC HARDWARE TUNING & ACCELERATION surveys the systems and what might be done to fine-tune their interworkings for best performance levels. Testing results are presented, web sites covering acceleration are provided, and keys to components are included.
N Dr. Harding's book, The Magic of Christmas/Christmas Unwrapped/X-mas Files is a fantastic and well researched book. Word to the wise. The Magic of Christmas is identical to Christmas Unwrapped and the X-mas Files by the same author. The publisher, for some unknown and absurd reason, republished this book under three different titles with three different publication dates.  <br /> <br />The overall theme of the book is excellent for showing the Amanita muscaria mushroom/shamanic origins of the Christmas story and even goes into some archaeoastronomy.  <br /> <br />Much of this same information has been revealed by James Arthur in Mushrooms and Mankind and by James Bursenos in The Resurrection of Santa Claus - (republished) Shaman's Drum Issue 68, 2005. Dr. Harding was probably the first to discover the information, and probably the last to go to print with it. James Arthur (2000) uses many of the same associations in his book (with no references - plagiarism?) and radio shows that he very likely took \\"some\\" material from Harding. Harding's book(s) are far better and more readable than James Highfield - The Physics of Christmas (1998), etc., which bases much of the work on Harding, though strays off numerous times into unrelated material. <br /> <br />However, save your money and only buy one of the 3 different versions of the book. I'm glad I needed extra Christmas presents, but I was actually looking forward to reading \\"further\\" research by Dr. Harding, not the same book under three different titles. I'm very disappointed in the deceptive tactics of his publisher not informing the public that they're all the same damn book. They don't even appear to be different editions. Same material, same page numbers, same everything page for page.  <br /> <br />Buy it, but only buy one.
N I would highly encourage anyone who is potty training a \\"book-loving\\" toddler to get this book. My son asks to have this read to him everytime we go into the potty.  <br />It's nice to have a little pattern going with him.  <br />Read the book, wash hands, get dressed.  <br />
N Being a stalwart fan of the fantasy genre I decided to put my skepticism aside, break down and give these \\"children's\\" books a go. This series is in line with a lot of classic entertainment touted as \\"children's\\" fare (e.g., original Bugs Bunny cartoons, The Hobbit, Chronicles of Narnia, among others): that is, much of it is aimed straight at the heart of adults. And it hits the mark.    I have finished the series up to Book Five and I must say that there have been some pretty grisly incidents for younger readers. However, one can assume that many of Rowling's younger readers have followed the books from the beginning, and grown as Harry Potter did. For the younger readers just starting, however, along about book four some of the material may be a tad startling or disconcerting.    In any case, I have found the writing to be thoroughly entertaining, particularly the effective use of tongue-in-cheek humor. There is a comical brattiness about many of the characters (professors, parents, and students alike) which plays pretty well. The childishness of the main characters can be a bit trying at times, I will admit; but it is forgivable and understandable...they are, after all, still kids.    The use of suggestion and mystery -- of questions that do not get answered till the end of the book -- can also be a bit trying at times, but it is also compelling and intriguing at the same time, and part of this author's trademark.    All in all, these are exciting, fast-paced books, truly classics in their own time, and I am duly impressed that they lived up to their hype in my mind, skeptic that I was. Five stars, for cripe's sake.
N To high school and my best friend and her boyfriend. It was scary how realistic this book is. It's a beautiful love story that had me up all night reading, I finished it in one day. A true page turner, comedy and tear jerker. A real quick read. Buy It!

N Though she is honored to be Chicago Woman of the Year, Victoria Colby-Camp is more euphoric over the mental improvement that her son Jim has shown recently especially since he and Tasha North fell in love.  Jim was snatched almost twenty years ago when he was seven and turned into the killing Seth whose goal was to murder Victoria for abandoning him.  However, her elation would turn to despair if she knew Seth resurfaced and started to rape a pregnant Tasha.<br /><br />Former military strategist Daniel Marks is in town complements of the Colby Agency that wants to hire him.  Also in Chicago is Emily Hastings whose father a veteran homicide detective was murdered.  She finds letters linking her dad to Victoria, the woman's long ago murdered first husband James, and her dad's first partner Marelyn Rutland that confuses her.  Soon she will meet Daniel and they will be embroiled in the COLBY CONSPIRACY that goes back almost two decades ago.<br /><br />Though the subplots can become confusing at first, once the audience comprehends how this complex superb suspense thriller starts to come together, they will want more Colby Agency tales; (see FILES FROM THE COLBY AGENCY: THE BODYGUARD'S BABY PROTECTIVE CUSTODY).  The ensemble cast is solid as fans will feel with Victoria who has overcome so much tragedy, hope Jim \\"defeats\\" Seth with Tasha at his side, and root for Daniel and Emily to make it while wondering what really happened two decades ago.  A final twist marks a strong Webb of deceit tale that showcases a fine author on her A-game.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
N When looking for &lt;a href=\\"[...]\\">lock picking books&lt;/a>, this one is very informative. It will give one great ideas on opening padlocks, but the language is very basic, no frills here. This is not a romance novel, it's how to open locks without keys, and that's it. You will learn what you need to here. But you should always seek out more knowledge.
Y Never been much for enjoying history, but the style, brevity, and choice of subject matter come together very nicely in this book.
Y If you are stumped for the perfect gift to bring to your dinner host, to give to your dinner guests, or for any other small gift occasion, Furry Logic is the answer.  Everyone loves this book.
Y At last... a comprehensive visual compendium of the most celebrated artistic promotional film marketing campaign worldwide... almost.  You would think that the opulent Mr. Sansweet would have in his possession every single poster to have ever rolled off the printing press for this unprecedented franchise but several of my favorite foreign one-sheets, daybills, banners and bus stop posters are notably missing.  Does this mean that Mr. Sansweet has not aquired all of them in his envious collection of Star Wars memorabilia?  Not likely.  Chances are he has every single one of them... locked away somewhere within the bowels of his coveted archives.  Most notably absent is the lack of reference material specifically promoting Revenge of the Sith and would seem to indicate that this book was completed and ready to be published just prior to the film's theatrical exhibition, but there is a plethora of wonderful international promotional material such as the six character U.K. bus stop posters that are much more visually exciting than the disappointing U.S. domestic ad campaign that demands to be published.  This can only mean that another volume must be sure to follow.  Still, there are enough international poster variations out there to keep collectors like myself and presumably Mr. Sansweet himself scouring the farthest reaches of the globe and the galaxy for years to come.
N During the reign of Henry VIII, at fourteen Elizabeth Meredith inherited Friarsgate when her mother and older middle sister married and moved onto their respective spouses' estate and her oldest sibling and her husband chose the king's court.  Eight years later she remains independent running her estate until her mother informs her she must marry so that an heir can inherit Friarsgate.<br /><br />Her beloved sixty years old Uncle Thomas agrees to escort the feisty landowner to court.  However, before they leave for London, Baen MacColl comes from Scotland at the behest of his father to discus a sheep deal.  As the two die in the wool anti-marital soul mates fall in love, Elizabeth chaperoned by her uncle travels to the king's court.  There she befriends the beleaguered queen while Henry VIII begins his campaign to replace his wife Katherine with Anne.<br /><br />The key to this battle between two independent obstinate loving combatants is the background that incorporates Henry's antics as he sets in motion his plan to remove Katherine of Aragon as queen and replace her with Anne Boleyn.  Bertrice Small cleverly uses the monumental sixteenth century events to tell her story of love yet in some ways the shadow overwhelms the lead characters.  Fans of historical romance with strong doses of both will enjoy the latest Meredith tale (see UNTIL YOU AND PHILIPPA).<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
N This book isn't merely a primer for capitalist thinking, it is a Bible for free enterprise.  Everyone on the planet should read MILLIONAIRE REPUBLICAN, then utilize the implements provided.  The result would be a peaceful, hard-working universe. <br /> <br />I look forward to the day Mr. Root becomes a novelist and weaves his philosophy through the prism of fiction.  MOVE OVER, AYN RAND.
N The Outlander series are my favorite books of all time, period.  But after reading the Fiery Cross, I was a bit let down, as many people were, and afraid that the rest of the series would just continue to go downhill.  So when A Breath of Snow and Ashes came out, I was so glad to see that it was getting good reviews.  I finally got to read it this week and was not disappointed in the least. <br />All the characters we know and love are back, and Brianna seems to have finally grow up.  She has been my least favorite character since the second book, but this time around she was actually likeable (for the most part).  At certain points this book became so intense that I actually had to put it down and take a break for awhile, but not all readers will have this experience, only ones that are practically obsessed with this series (and who's friends have to remind them, \\"Jamie is NOT a real person!).    <br />So basically, if you have read the previous books, just read this one. Please.  You won't regret it.  The only reason I didn't give this one five stars is that I think nothing can top Outlander and Dragonfly in Amber.  If I could give this 4.5, I would. <br /> <br />One thing I have wondered about - if Claire dies back in the 1700's, then she'll be born again in 1918, go back in time in 1946, die in the 1700's, be born in 1918, and just keep repeating this forever.  For all she knows this could be her tenth time doing this.  I haven't seen this matter dealt with in the books.  Did I just miss it or something?
Y This is a marvelous read, and those already familiar with the Abel Jones series will not be disappointed.  Again, I am amazed and appreciative of the amount of research that Mr. Parry puts into his novels, and this book is a prime example.  It is a wonderful story that not only entertains, but also enlightens about one of the most important eras in our history, and, one of the most important cities and cultures (New Orleans) in our country.  I couldn't put it down and read it all in one sitting.  Thank again to the author, and I look forward to reading about how the venerable Abel Jones will come to grips with his latest personal struggle regarding family over duty!
N The premise of the book is hilarious: Dick and Jane, all grown up and still living in suburbia. But this isn't the suburbia of Ward and June Cleaver. It's the suburbia of \\"Desperate Housewives\\" with a Yiddish twist.<br /><br />It made me nostalgic for my years living in Miami Beach. Oy ve, where did the years go? Even the goyim who didn't grow up hearing Yiddish will love this book.
N This attractively illustrated book provides a showcase of Israel's achievements in fields as diverse as agriculture, education, medicine, science and technology. It looks at the technologies, processes and the products from this tiny little land that are improving the lives of so many people. The authors highlight some of the people responsible for this ingenuity that is benefiting the whole world.<br /><br />For example, at the Weizmann Institute, Dr Michal Schwartz has developed a way of harnessing immune system cells to repair and revive damaged nerve fibres. Other medical breakthroughs include the miniscule camera-in-a-tablet used for internal diagnosis, ultrasound for destroying tumours and Israel's highly effective disaster relief operations.<br /><br />A great help to third world people has been the discovery by scientist Yoel Margalith of the Bti bacterium that kills certain kinds of flies and harmful mosquitoes.  This has already saved millions of livers and is an environment-friendly intervention. Most remarkable is that Margalith is a holocaust survivor, of both the Bergen-Belsen and Teresienstadt camps.<br /><br />In many fields Israel is so far ahead of the pack that other countries have no chance of catching up. One of the most interesting innovations developed in Israel is a project to avoid collisions between aircraft and migratory birds. It involved the study of the flight paths of birds. This work of researcher Yossi Leshem is now also used by the Jordanian and Turkish air-force.<br /><br />Israel has more engineers per capita than any other country on earth and a remarkable number of hi-tech companies. Innovation in the fields of computers and information technology is particularly impressive. This encompasses software, operating systems, storage & retrieval systems, verification and firewall technologies, plus a host of mobile phone applications.<br /><br />Israel's creativity is not restricted to science and technology, as there is also much happening in arts and culture. Despite its small size and its many enemies, this country is bursting with creative energy and making a huge contribution to the global marketplace and to quality of life worldwide.<br /><br />The founders of this brave country were aware that Israel had almost no natural resources and that its people therefore had to develop and apply their brainpower. Well, they are succeeding spectacularly. What a pity that Israel has to devote so much of its money and resources to protect itself from its neighbours! If its full genius were given free reign, it would become even more of a blessing to the world.ts small size and its many enemies, this country is bursting with creative energy and making a huge contribution to the global marketplace and to quality of life worldwide.

N \\"Last Chance to See\\" is Douglas Adams' hilarious and though-provoking non-fiction, eco-travel narrative about circling the globe in search of some of the Earth's most endangered animals. We get to see a side of Adams that is deeply concerned with the plight of the beautiful, unique, and often ludicrously implausible lifeforms on our planet -- the same side that prompted him to climb Mount Kilimanjaro in a rhino suit.     What made this book all the more meaningful to me was that I'd thought I'd finished all of Douglas Adams' books long ago. I loved them all, but I never fully appreciated the depth of his genius as a humanist and social satirist until, sadly, he had passed away.  What's more, I never realized how much Adams' writings meant to me until I was hit with the cold, hard reality that he'd written all he ever would.  Douglas Adams had hitched his last ride across the galaxy, and I'd never hear from him again.  Or so I thought.    Infinitely improbable as it may seem, I heard from Douglas Adams again about two weeks ago.  I was browsing around in Borders, long since resigned to the fact that I'd read the last \\"new\\" Douglas Adams book I ever would, when I stumbled upon \\"Last Chance to See.\\" I felt like I'd gone into the pet store to buy a parakeet and, instead, found a dodo bird.      The endangered species Douglas Adams criss-crossed the globe in search of are all, in their own ways, remarkable and priceless. He urges us not to wait until they're gone to fully appreciate them, and he drives this point home to today's readers, in his own ironic style, by now being himself \\"extinct.\\"    If you're a Douglas Adams fan, and you've never read this book, here it is -- your own \\"last chance to see\\" (or, rather, read) him.  His own voice, his own words, his own experiences.  For me, it was a fond farewell from an old friend I'd never met, who, from his new home -- far beyond life, the universe, and everything -- telling me, \\"Yes, I'm dead. But there are still a few rhinos and gorillas and dolphins that aren't. Do me a favor; make sure they stay that way.\\"
N In a not too distant future, Angel is a certified Retribution Specialist (CRS), which means that when the law fails to bring justice, the victims can hire a CRS to bring in the perpetrator of the crime to them to enact their own justice.  When a closed case is reopened, Angel is again under investigation for \\"what happened\\" the night policeman Danny Black died.  On top of dealing with this, her mother, Lola, gets kidnapped, and Angel knows that if she doesn't rescue Lola herself, she might die. <br /> <br />Because she has Detective Marco following her and questioning her movements - from the past as well as during the events he witnesses personally, she starts finding things out about herself she really didn't want to know...like her exceptionally good luck.  It may not be luck after all; the physic abilities Lola has may actually be genuine and she inherited them.  <br /> <br />KISS OF THE BLUE DRAGON is the second story I've read by Julie Beard, and I actually like her writing style better here.  The story is written in first person, which can drive readers batty (me too upon occasion); however, it works here.  There is a different \\"feel\\" to KISS completely.  For me, I can \\"hear\\" a narrator filling in the details of Angels' activities.  So even though we, as a reader, only get to know her thoughts and impressions of what she sees, we still get to know what is going on around her.  You get to know Angel, what motivates her and see how she thinks very well.  I also really liked the fact that a lot of simple details of her life are included. <br />  <br />I will admit it was a close call as to whether I would like Angel or not.  She almost doesn't seem feminine.  However, if you read a little further into the book, you learn what her logic is, how she thinks but more importantly WHY.  Angel is tough, spunky, kick-butt heroine and out to help those unable to help themselves.  She is fearless and makes her decisions based on what is right rather than whether she willget hurt or not.  Angel is one busy lady.  She has cases that she maintains during the process of rescuing Lola and I liked the fact that Julie Beard didn't drop some of these issues, therefore the story stays three dimensional.   <br /> <br />While the reopened investigation is secondary to what is going on in her life, it is what brings our hero and heroine together.  I was happy with the chemistry between her and Detective Marco even if the bedroom scenes take place off of the books pages.   <br /> <br />I like the fact that even though KISS is a science-fiction romance, the author doesn't go out of her way to create objects that will stump the reader, or throw off the flow of the novel.  For an example: in a time where DNA left behind is what would keep you in jail, rather than using a hollow-tip bullet, a criminal would use a bullet filled with acid therefore destroying the evidence.   <br /> <br />KISS is technically supposed to be a romance, but with the way this story ends, we don't have our heroine hooking up with the hero.  Because Lola was kidnapped by one of the Chicago mobs there are still some unresolved issues that its sequel might wrap up.  Regardless, I didn't feel like major details were left out or the story wasn't well developed.  As a reader I didn't find myself wondering, \\"what just happened\\"?   <br /> <br />I found KISS OF THE BLUE DRAGON very interesting, and look forward to reading the further adventures of Angel in its sequel TOUCH OF THE WHITE TIGER.  So, if you are looking for something a little different, check out this story!
Y National Geographic Traveler is the best series of its type, and the NGT Thailand book has the same standards of quality as all the others.  It provides an excellent mix of written descriptions and beautiful pictures, both of which are helpful in determining whether to include places on your trip itinerary.  The only flaw is that the hotel and meal section is not particularly useful.
N \\"Truth vs Falsehood\\" is Hawkins' 4th book. In my mind, it is his greatest gift yet, but not in the sense that one might think. This will be explained in the closing. I will also preface by saying that I am in no way political. Truth is all that I am interested in. <br />   In Hawkins' previous 3 books, the kinesiological response was portrayed as infallible. His language was very absolute in its tone, giving the technique more credibility than it has ever received. Being so absolute with one's tone was the first obvious clue. When one becomes absolute in their tone, they often put an inordinate amount of faith in something outside themselves and overlook the inherent limitations. This is true for everything from religious absolutism to the mythical cure-all in medicine. The person who uses the absolute tone acts as if your salvation lies with this one particular thing.  <br />   I am a traditional naturopath. I was using kinesiology before Hawkins' books, and I am closely connected to practitioners of kinesiology who've used it in excess of 20 years. An observant and curious practitioner quickly realizes that the intent of both the testee and tester influences response. In some cases, a strong-willed practitioner who thinks he knows the cause of imbalance or dis-ease is affecting testee response and in essence using kinesiology to validate his own opinions and beliefs, albeit unknowingly. He will get the positive response he desires, whereas the practitioner with no vested interest in anything except the truth will get a different response on the same testee.  <br />   It has been difficult for me to bridge the gap between Hawkins' theory/ doctoral thesis on his use of kinesiology and the understanding that most experienced practitioners of kinesiology have. Nearly all experienced practitioners simply don't find the technique to be infallible. Certain criteria must be met for accurate response. Those criteria are training, impartiality, and the sincere and humble desire to put absolute truth above all things. Truth is absolute, but the technique is not. Remaining neutral is an ongoing challenge for the practitioner. <br /> <br />   I am not familiar with the testing methods used for Hawkins' doctoral thesis \\"Quantitative and Qualitative Calibration of the Levels of Consciousness\\". However, for it to withstand any scientific scrutiny, both the tester and testee would have to be without any knowledge on the subject matter. There would also have to be at least 20 different testers for the 3000+ test subjects, with each tester coming up with their own test responses to a given list of questions. Responses would not be compared until all testers have compiled their findings. For his thesis, something along these lines was most likely used.  <br />   Throughout \\"Power vs. Force\\", a healthy skepticism was maintained towards Hawkins putting so much faith in this technique. Part of this was based on an inability to get the same responses he was getting. The information presented in \\"The Eye of the I\\" and \\"I\\" was absolutely astounding, and skepticism was temporarily set aside. Apparently, his intent was pure and sincere enough to allow him to experience absolute truth on spiritual inquiry. Much of this can be attributed to his description of a life-changing experience. He was atheist (or possibly agnostic... don't remember which), hit a major crisis in his life, and finally called out in total humility to be shown the truth of God. I feel his pure intent allowed him to access the truth he did. <br />   However, once Hawkins gained confidence in the technique, he apparently fell into the trap of thinking he could divorce himself from influencing response. The methods used for gleaning the information found in \\"Truth vs Falsehood\\" would surely not withstand any scientific scrutiny. The simple fact that the subject matter was familiar to the tester(s) and testee(s) disqualifies it. Asking about the nature of life, death, and other unknown spiritual matters is not the same as asking about one's perceived reality, which one already has strong opinions and emotions about and attachments to. Both testers and testees would have to be completely unfamiliar with the line of inquiry to have any guarantee of neutrality. <br /> <br />   Within 30 seconds of opening \\"Truth vs Falsehood\\", it was clear something wasn't right. Hawkins' 3 previous books have helped us to discern truth from falsehood more clearly. Many of us have reached a place where now we `just know' the truth. It is often a clear gut feeling, and at that point the kinesiological response seems unnecessary. In a way, it turns out the technique was only a tool to guide us to our own inner knowing.  <br />   Hawkins acknowledges the existence of ignorance and untruth, but does not address the issue of deliberate deception. It is ironic that after years of devotion to the truth, Hawkins still does not fully grasp the nature of deception. The world citizenry is currently experiencing one of the most elaborate mass brainwashes in history.  <br />   In fact, Hawkins even engages in deception when he explains the Iraq situation. He indicates that the primary reason to be there is to protect the world's (and specifically America's) economic and oil interests. Yet the primary reason given to the public for going to war was weapons of mass destruction. Whether or not it was a fact that there were actually WMDs misses the point. It was given as the main reason, and it was not. That is deception. For Hawkins to agree with the idea of justifiable deceptions is a clear indicator that he is not neutral here. <br />   More importantly, for Hawkins to act as if outright deception is not occurring speaks to one's ability to deal with reality. For a person with 80 years of conditioned perception of reality to have reality turned on its head, a person could have a serious breakdown. <br /> <br />   The gift in this 4th book is that Hawkins has shown us what thekinesiological technique can and cannot be used for. It can be used by the sincere truthseeker for his/herself. However, it is not to be used to show one a reality they are not ready to see. There is no technique to make one see the truth. One's clear and sincere intention is all that can do that. And even then, one may not be ready to handle the fullness of reality. The process of how one \\"wakes up\\" is yet to be known. <br />   Who better than Hawkins to show us that experience is no substitute for impartiality? So, the readers of his 4th book get the opportunity to discern what is truth and what is his belief. The first 3 books prepared us, and the 4th is the test. Although he didn't intend it to work this way, it is the greatest gift of all. And just as importantly, it shows us that one can be quite enlightened in one area, while not having it all together in another. Even when one crosses the 600 line, one is still assailed by falsity and ignorance and must be constantly vigilant and unattached to one's beliefs.  <br /> <br />   And realistically, it couldn't have happened any other way. Given Hawkins' first 3 books and his audience, if he gave us the absolute truth about all the deceptions that make up the current perceived reality, it could have seriously messed some people up. It could result in serious mental breakdown if it was said that there aren't actually arab terrorists creating terror in America. So, the book had to be presented this way. And those of us who know the real truth know it through our own inner knowing already and don't need Hawkins to tell us. <br />   In `The Art of War', Sun Tzu said, \\"All warfare is based on deception.\\" Well, currently we have warfare in nearly every form. Even `necessary' and `justified' wars have deception as their roots. <br /> <br />Michael <br />Santa Fe, New Mexico
Y It is to Jane Hyun's credit to discuss issues of Asian American professionals on a very practical level. There are however, some caveats for the reader. The book needs to be contextualized within a larger conceptual framework. The overarching issues are ignored within her practical framework, namely: Who needs to change? Who needs to accommodate whom?  How much? What are the risks and benefits? Her book appears to be saying that corporate America needs to understand Asians, but it does not need to change.  Rather it is the Asian professional that needs to change and adapt. <br /> <br />Is the book too heavily assimilationist?  It is not clear as Hyun does make a distinction early in her book between assimilation (\\"adopting ...at the expense of one's own cultural characteristics\\") and acculturation (\\"adapting ...while continuing to maintain values, perspectives, and features of one's native culture\\"). <br /> <br />There appears to be little adaptation of any Asian models or perspective to the mainstream USA corporate culture -- page 279 suggests two ways: \\"Develop cultural competency\\" and \\"Make use of your bicultural and bilingual abilities.\\" While recognizing the dominance of USA/Western research and models in the business world, it is also logical and no \\"one model fits all.\\" Perhaps future research and practices can provide indigenous Asian models or perspectives that can be adapted and work effectively in coporate America or other cultures.  The Special Issue on China & India (Business Week, August 22/29, 2005) points out how some USA business models are not applicable. <br /> <br />It is not an either/or proposition.  By utilizing the juxtaposition of the Asian behavior/values system versus the Western behavior/values system to present her central thesis, Hyun creates a false dichotomy in the mind of the reader. Current business literature is filled with exhortations of \\"win/win,\\" \\"both/and,\\" \\"alignment,\\" and \\"interdependence\\" -- all very Asian concepts. These traditional Asian cultural values are at the very heart of what contemporary corporate America is trying to effect in order to add value. So there is a \\"baby with the bath water\\" caveat here to the reader.  The accommodation needs to be reciprocal, not unilateral. <br /> <br />In her Epilogue, Hyun encourages the reader to \\"Develop an Action Plan That Works with Your Persona.\\"  It seems throughout her book that the emphasis is on asking the reader to tailor his or her persona to that which is required for success in corporate America, not on utilizing the behavioral strengths and cognitive positions with which someone who comes with a strong Asian cultural background is imbued.  Being Asian -- it seems to Hyun -- puts one in a deficit position. <br /> <br />The reader needs to be cautious in the self-assessment, individual profiles, exercises and tools cited. They yield helpful descriptive self-awareness profiles and information, not diagnostic or predictive profiles, and they are dependent on situational factors. There are many suggestions, based perhaps on many years of experience, but empirical data demonstrating their reliability, validity or efficacy are not mentioned. <br /> <br />Kudos to Hyun for encouraging the seeking of regular and frequent performance feedback. This is a career self-monitoring technique that is utilized far too little by all employees to help document and strengthen requests for job and salary advancement.  In spite of the conceptual conundrums, this highly practical book is a must read. <br /> <br />Adrian Chan (Kochman Mavrelis Associates, Oak Park, IL) & Barry Mar (Management & Resources Associates, Seattle, WA) <br />
N Dobson begins her easy-to-read book with chapters appropriately titled \\"Helping Your Child Love Learning\\" and \\"Creating Your Own Educational Reform\\". After reading just these two chapters I was already in love with the book.<br /><br />The remaining chapters consist of reader contributed ideas, lessons and games. These parents know how to make education so fun the kids probably won't even know they are learning! The ideas are easy, fast, inexpensive, and usually involve minimal research.<br /><br />What really makes this book stand far and above others is Table 2.2, found on pages 34-37. This helpful table lists many popular off-the-shelf curriculums that can be easily recreated at home with materials you already have, or can be found used - all for under $100!<br /><br />This book is truly ingenious! It's about time someone organized the ideas of creative parents into one handy reference. I cannot think of a better person to present this material other a personal favorite, Linda Dobson.
N I've read almost every book written on the Beatles and found Cynthia's story poignant and from the heart.  She's had a hard time finding her true self in the shadows of her larger-than-life men and marriages and she persists despite the setbacks and enjoys the adventures. <br /> <br />The first half of the book is almost identical to her earlier book, Twist of Lennon in 1989.  I've not read much about her or Julian from 1980 on and it is interesting to look at behind-the-scenes reflections vs. what the public sees.  Julian: Sing again in your own key and forget about Them. <br /> <br />If you are a '42-years And Counting' Beatles fan like me, then  you will enjoy this book.  There are some unreleased pictues you'll relish from Cyn's family album. <br /> <br />All You Need Is Love, oh yeah, yet there wuz a lot of hurtin' souls along Penny Lane besides Eleanor Rigby or Sgt. Pepper. The price of fame which is not fleeting here. <br /> <br />Donna Coulson
N I have searched and searched for a great Arthurian retelling and have been disappointed with the ones I have ventured into reading. I was somewhat skeptical when I picked up Nancy McKenzie's Queen of Camelot. This two-novels-in-one compilation is based on Guenevere, from her point of view, in first person narrative, and is 623 pages long in very small print. I didn't want to waste my time reading something this big only to be disappointed at the end. I nevertheless gave the book a whirl. Glad I did! This is one of the most compelling and beautifully told retells I have ever read! McKenzie gives us a detailed story about Guenevere from her point of view. She tells us about the prophecy on the day she was born, how she spends her childhood as an adventurous tomboy, how people fear her and treat her differently as she grows up, how the knights around her battle with the Saxons, and how all of the prophecies come true. She meets Arthur, marries him and later has a love affair with Lancelot, something based on the original tale. But the novel has so much more than that. You will see how this story of magic, prophecies, love and betrayal transpires in an altered, detailed and beautiful light. There are many twists throughout the novel.<br /><br />Guenevere is developed in such an abundant, three-dimensional way in this novel. She is no longer just the pagan beauty who marries a Christian, betrays him and destroys all of Camelot as a result. She is a complex character with flaws as well as virtues in this offering. Arthur is also written in a more interesting, compelling way here, but it is Lancelot that once again blows me away. I have always romanticized Sir Lancelot and McKenzie does not disappoint me in her version of the loyal, chivalrous knight. Merlin and Morgan Le Fay are written with much complexity and nuance as well. This novel, however, does not focus so much on the love triangle between Guenevere, Arthur and Lancelot as much as her inability to supply an heir for Arthur and her affection for Arthur's bastard son, the traitorous Mordred. The overall story is magnificent. Once again, I say that McKenzie did a wonderful job bringing Guenevere to life. She turns this character into a strong, intelligent, complex, three-dimensional, flesh and blood woman, someone you will feel a great deal of affinity with. She is not portrayed as a simple-minded, traitorous hussy in this one! I loved the fanciful storytelling style that made me turn the pages until the wee hours of the night. Some of my friends who read the book along with me complained about it being too long-winded. I didn't think it was long-winded at all. In fact, I wish it had been longer. I loved this book and I look forward to giving Grail Prince a whirl.for Arthur and her affection for Arthur's bastard son, the traitorous Mordred. The overall story is magnificent.

N This author will be on the Coast2Coast radio show tonight 10/13/05 at 10PM PT. I will do a review at that time. Yes, I've read the book, but I need to ask him some questions before I rate this one folks. This is one of those books that will stir you up, make you ask questions, and allow you to accept the answers. My review will be posted after the George Noory interview...
N I was hoping that the book would be better than the television show, and it wasn't. The show, with its amusing quips, puns and overreaching pseudointellectual analyses of female behavior, is entertaining in a vegetative sort of way. The book should have had more depth. Yes, I'm sure there are women in NYC who claim to be looking for love as they hop from bed to bed hoping to change men into what they want. I hope to high Heaven that the denizens of real NYC are nothing like the flaky women in Candace Bushnell's Sex In The City. Mr. Big is just as egregious in the book as he's portrayed in the HBO show. On the plus side, Patricial Field does a great job with Carrie's wardrobe on the show.
Y Champlin bravely asserts his own contribution to the great wealth of Neronian scholarship for the critics to pick apart. I find very little to quibble about.<br />It is difficult to write even-handedly about Nero for a Western audience. Who could forget the image of a man who \\"fiddled while Rome burned\\" or the terrible tyrant who had begun a nearly 170 year \\"persecution\\" of the early Christians, under whose reign both Peter and Paul were executed? As other reviewer comments reveal, you can easily earn the brand of a Nero \\"apologist\\" if you don't tow the party line, however inaccurate it might be.<br /><br />Champlin's thesis can be stated simply as follows: many, if not most of Nero's grandstands and outrageous actions, were performed out of considerable political shrewdness and calculation - not the madness or puerile excess wrongly attributed to a \\"live fast, die young, and leave a good looking corpse\\" emperor. Nero's success, Champlin argues in the first chapter, is evinced by a shockingly prolonged \\"afterlife\\" manifested in pseudo-Neros, Judeo-Christian apocalyptic writings, and a disenfranchised populace openly lamenting his death. Nonetheless, I cannot help but wonder, (working on the same assumption,) whether he had truly orchestrated his public relations as well as Champlin suggests given his untimely demise at age 30.<br /><br />Some reviewers disagree, but I reckon Champlin's original Nero-Periander link to be one of the most intriguing ideas in ancient biography I've ever seen. The ambivalent relationship with the mother, the Philhellenism, the artistic bent, and the numerous other links are too compelling to ignore outright, even if the conclusion a hard sell. Further research is warranted, but I suspect that Champlin, with his great intellect and energy, may have already exhausted all of the available evidence for advancing his thesis. He demonstrates the Augustus/Antony connections thoroughly. The discussion of the great fire of 64 is arrestingly well done: after convincingly presenting the defense for Nero's innocence, he suddenly shatters the deception in stating that despite this preceding evidence, Nero undoubtedly held direct responsibility for the coflagration. It hits you with dramatic effect almost equal to one of the primary sources comprising the centerpiece of his proof in this sudden reversal: Tacitus' Annales XV.67.<br /><br />Champlin's organization is somewhat bothersome as it is in \\"Final Judgments,\\" because he rejects chronological arrangement for thematic foci. This requires repetition of several facts, and I cannot understand his reasons for the chapter order. The post-mortem legacy of Nero, being most fascinating, he puts up front obviously to hook his reader. It serves as an interesting set piece for further discourse, because the inevitable wonder we feel about Nero's impression on the world ever after demands explanation: thus the rest of the book. But with Dio, Suetonius, and Tacitus unfolding the bulk of their own histories so methodically, the rearrangement isn't always a neat fit. Still, Champlin's brilliant weaving together of hundreds of sources, as before, vindicates his literary decisions several times over.<br /><br />Champlin, like any other historian, has his hypotheses and directs his evidence toward proving them. His presentation however, is replete with past scholarship and primary sources presented candidly and fairly. One of the most appreciable inclusions is the extensive collection of Latin graffiti, which add a critical dimension to our knowledge. This book has been for me an introduction into full-strength Neronian scholarship and I found it both accessible and empowering enough to read further with confidence.ngly presenting the defense for Nero's innocence, he suddenly shatters the deception in stating that despite this preceding evidence, Nero undoubtedly held direct responsibility for the coflagration.

N While I don't always agree with his TV analysis, I enjoy Mr. Crawford's commentaries. His book, however, is surprisingly shallow and can be summed up in one chapter with footnotes. I didn't realize an intentional misquoting of Thomas Jefferson on page 2 (easy enough to catch as the footnote provides the actual quote) was a foreshadowing of the paraphrasing to come. Almost all his sources are the very media he criticizes.    Yes, the media should be astute and critical of anyone in power anywhere, yet it isn't, mostly because it has been corporatized. vilified and because reporters and organizations have wimped out. OK, yes, and....?     Since Crawford is a journalist, one who claims an inside view of what really goes on, he is obligated by the same standards he poses not just to say this is what went on, but to explain why manipulation is allowed and what to do about it. Tom Fenton in his book, Bad News, does a more thorough job of explaining the links between money and reporting and providing a context for media manipulation and journalistic reticence.     Crawford gives specific examples of manipulation, but doesn't provide motive or context beyond the trite \\"politicians manipulate the media so they can look better so they can become powerful.\\" Therein lies the point, if the media is powerful enough that it needs to be manipulated, then it is powerful enough to hold its own. Why hasn't the media held its own and why aren't people demanding a real public discussion? What does the messenger do with the message he was supposed to deliver?    Crawford says people are tuning to outlets to verify their beliefs so news outlets are becoming customer-driven reinforcing agents. If that's true, why is the media making that choice instead of taking the lead? Politicians do attack the messenger, but often they don't have to, because the messenger has been co-opted. More dangerously, by giving hyperbole public time and space, the news media cuts its own throat then calls it a tracheotomy.    Still, despite the flaws, I stayed with the book's limited scope until page 117. \\"I don't vote....\\" With that, Crawford's credibility flew out the window.     \\"I fear it will make it more difficult to keep my observations down the middle.\\" After 116 pages of caterwalling about professional and personal responsibility, about the consequences to democracy of a media manipulated by power, about how the media is responsible to its constituents, the public, and should judge both the quality and importance of its \\"message,\\" Crawford absolves himself of any duty, responsibility or personal judgment. His book becomes a version of \\"do as I say, not as I do.\\" Worse yet, the core of his argument is a tautology: journalists must give up the rights and responsibilities of citizenship to uphold the rights and responsibilitites of citizenship. Talk about attacking the messenger, the messenger just committed suicide.     Come on, get in the muck with the rest of us, make tough decisions, make judgments. It's in the choosing that one gains perspective and insight. Not voting because you're a journalist is like saying a Yankee fan can't write about baseball or deciding not to eat anything, ever, so no one will know you don't like brocolli.    As Jim Hightower put it, \\"There ain't nothin' in the middle of the road but yellow stripes and dead armadillos.\\"
N Mr. Andersons' book provides a thorough examination, diagnosis, and best possible cure for what ails black america. Not poor whites, hispanics, arabs, jews, gays, or white women. You owe it to you and your family to at least check out the facts of this examination and then decide.  <br /> <br />White america has always put their modus operandi in our face; this is our society, these are our rules, do the best you can with what we decide to give you; don't bother me while I make my money. If you do, the police will handle you. <br /> <br />Here is Black americas' call to focus on what should have been the legacy of civil rights - economic empowerment.
Y This book has been fascinating to read. It is evident, as a student of comparative religion, that the author has done some careful research and integrated it successfully in the book. A lot has to be said for some major research flaws, such as often referring to Sufis (Islamic mystics) and Mosques, even though Islam wasn't to arrive for another 650 years! Overall, it is an entertaining book and will provide you with an interesting alternative for the life of Jesus, an alternative that is likely, not fictional.<br /><br />Enjoy, but do filter the content.

N Though she is honored to be Chicago Woman of the Year, Victoria Colby-Camp is more euphoric over the mental improvement that her son Jim has shown recently especially since he and Tasha North fell in love.  Jim was snatched almost twenty years ago when he was seven and turned into the killing Seth whose goal was to murder Victoria for abandoning him.  However, her elation would turn to despair if she knew Seth resurfaced and started to rape a pregnant Tasha.<br /><br />Former military strategist Daniel Marks is in town complements of the Colby Agency that wants to hire him.  Also in Chicago is Emily Hastings whose father a veteran homicide detective was murdered.  She finds letters linking her dad to Victoria, the woman's long ago murdered first husband James, and her dad's first partner Marelyn Rutland that confuses her.  Soon she will meet Daniel and they will be embroiled in the COLBY CONSPIRACY that goes back almost two decades ago.<br /><br />Though the subplots can become confusing at first, once the audience comprehends how this complex superb suspense thriller starts to come together, they will want more Colby Agency tales; (see FILES FROM THE COLBY AGENCY: THE BODYGUARD'S BABY PROTECTIVE CUSTODY).  The ensemble cast is solid as fans will feel with Victoria who has overcome so much tragedy, hope Jim \\"defeats\\" Seth with Tasha at his side, and root for Daniel and Emily to make it while wondering what really happened two decades ago.  A final twist marks a strong Webb of deceit tale that showcases a fine author on her A-game.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
N Review based on a cursory examination by University of Phoenix students in Philosophy 251.  <br />We have found the book to be well organized, and detailed. The structure placed the information in an easy to read and presentable manner. <br />The use of strong and sound proofs by experiment and examples supported the overall logic of reasoning in a clear and concise manner. <br />We have found the book to be well thought out and laid out so the reader can learn and follow what is being explained. <br />
N My only complaint is that this book was a bit repetative, and Holden's vocabulary only consists of 4 words: sonuvabitch, goddamn, lousy and phony. It was still quite humorous and the actual story was interesting.<br /><br />It was easy to read and to relate to, so you should pick it up if you're looking for a fun read. Some people complain about the lack of a plot, but to understand this book you need to read deeper into it. It's actually a lot more than some annoying kid's list of complaints about life.<br /><br />The story is about Holden Caulfield's coming of age and realizing that growing up is not a process that can be stopped. He had a lousy childhood, as he puts it, and wants to save other children from going though the things he experienced in his life. He is telling the story from a mental institution, which he was placed in after returning home from the fourth Prep school he had been kicked out of. He flashes back to the events leading up to his arrival at his home and tells the story of those 3 days.
N When looking for &lt;a href=\\"[...]\\">lock picking books&lt;/a>, this one is very informative. It will give one great ideas on opening padlocks, but the language is very basic, no frills here.

Y Never been much for enjoying history, but the style, brevity, and choice of subject matter come together very nicely in this book.
N I thoroughly enjoyed reading Faith is a verb by Chris Goodrich. The book covers facts regarding the history of the organization Habitat for Humanity and the author's experiences volunteering. Goodrich writes about the places, the people, and the volunteers he has encountered during his five-year experience with Habitat for Humanity. The author speaks straight from the heart, some of which brought tears to my eyes, some of sadness, some of laughter. Even through all the heart-wrenching sights, Goodrich and his crew persevere, regardless of the obstacles they face. Goodrich's experiences include traveling around the world, from America to London from London to Paraguay even getting lost in the Sierra, Faith is a Verb, is a fantastic read. In addition, the book opens a person's eyes and heart to the devastation and suffering that many see everyday of their lives. The book puts into perspective just how lucky we are even though we may not think so; it made me not only look at my ethics and values but also encouraged me to pick up that hammer.
Y If you are stumped for the perfect gift to bring to your dinner host, to give to your dinner guests, or for any other small gift occasion, Furry Logic is the answer.  Everyone loves this book.
Y At last... a comprehensive visual compendium of the most celebrated artistic promotional film marketing campaign worldwide... almost.  You would think that the opulent Mr. Sansweet would have in his possession every single poster to have ever rolled off the printing press for this unprecedented franchise but several of my favorite foreign one-sheets, daybills, banners and bus stop posters are notably missing.  Does this mean that Mr. Sansweet has not aquired all of them in his envious collection of Star Wars memorabilia?  Not likely.  Chances are he has every single one of them... locked away somewhere within the bowels of his coveted archives.  Most notably absent is the lack of reference material specifically promoting Revenge of the Sith and would seem to indicate that this book was completed and ready to be published just prior to the film's theatrical exhibition, but there is a plethora of wonderful international promotional material such as the six character U.K. bus stop posters that are much more visually exciting than the disappointing U.S. domestic ad campaign that demands to be published.  This can only mean that another volume must be sure to follow.  Still, there are enough international poster variations out there to keep collectors like myself and presumably Mr. Sansweet himself scouring the farthest reaches of the globe and the galaxy for years to come.
N To his discredit, Dr. Unwin virtually brags in the introductory chapter that nearly all of the questions and arguments that have mystified pterosaurs since their discovery have been answered in recent years,  but when it comes time to reveal those answers, Unwin typically sidesteps. Origins? Still not sure. Family tree? With over a hundred genera to choose from,  and many recently discovered, Unwin falls back on a favorite few and places them on an antique tree, not a modern cladogram. While Unwin's writing style is refreshing and easy to read (every chapter opens with short fiction), and his photos are first rate, the line work is rarely original and never detailed. Almost nothing is shown from the neck down. Only skulls are presented. Most, if not all, of the drawings  are recognizable from other sources. So, a disappointed reader here.
N I read this book over a couple of days.  It was hard to put down.  The things I liked best about this book were very interesting characters that made you think hard about them, a plot filled with suspense to the end, multiple subplots that merged well together, and a lean writing style that let me focus mostly on the characters and the provocative web I found them in.  This is a very thougthfully crafted story. I think most anyone would enjoy this novel.  Highly recommended.
N During the reign of Henry VIII, at fourteen Elizabeth Meredith inherited Friarsgate when her mother and older middle sister married and moved onto their respective spouses' estate and her oldest sibling and her husband chose the king's court.  Eight years later she remains independent running her estate until her mother informs her she must marry so that an heir can inherit Friarsgate.<br /><br />Her beloved sixty years old Uncle Thomas agrees to escort the feisty landowner to court.  However, before they leave for London, Baen MacColl comes from Scotland at the behest of his father to discus a sheep deal.  As the two die in the wool anti-marital soul mates fall in love, Elizabeth chaperoned by her uncle travels to the king's court.  There she befriends the beleaguered queen while Henry VIII begins his campaign to replace his wife Katherine with Anne.<br /><br />The key to this battle between two independent obstinate loving combatants is the background that incorporates Henry's antics as he sets in motion his plan to remove Katherine of Aragon as queen and replace her with Anne Boleyn.  Bertrice Small cleverly uses the monumental sixteenth century events to tell her story of love yet in some ways the shadow overwhelms the lead characters.  Fans of historical romance with strong doses of both will enjoy the latest Meredith tale (see UNTIL YOU AND PHILIPPA).<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
N Due to deregulation, a national company holding a monopoly in the transportation industry requested my consulting services to prepare for this upcoming change. Using Dr. Cohen's book as my reference and bench-mark, I could easily follow and prepare a solid consulting proposal, and when accepted, to work it out and present it successfully. I strongly recommend this book to consulting novices and veterans alike.
N This book isn't merely a primer for capitalist thinking, it is a Bible for free enterprise.  Everyone on the planet should read MILLIONAIRE REPUBLICAN, then utilize the implements provided.  The result would be a peaceful, hard-working universe. <br /> <br />I look forward to the day Mr. Root becomes a novelist and weaves his philosophy through the prism of fiction.  MOVE OVER, AYN RAND.
N The Outlander series are my favorite books of all time, period.  But after reading the Fiery Cross, I was a bit let down, as many people were, and afraid that the rest of the series would just continue to go downhill.  So when A Breath of Snow and Ashes came out, I was so glad to see that it was getting good reviews.  I finally got to read it this week and was not disappointed in the least. <br />All the characters we know and love are back, and Brianna seems to have finally grow up.  She has been my least favorite character since the second book, but this time around she was actually likeable (for the most part).  At certain points this book became so intense that I actually had to put it down and take a break for awhile, but not all readers will have this experience, only ones that are practically obsessed with this series (and who's friends have to remind them, \\"Jamie is NOT a real person!).    <br />So basically, if you have read the previous books, just read this one. Please.  You won't regret it.  The only reason I didn't give this one five stars is that I think nothing can top Outlander and Dragonfly in Amber.  If I could give this 4.5, I would. <br /> <br />One thing I have wondered about - if Claire dies back in the 1700's, then she'll be born again in 1918, go back in time in 1946, die in the 1700's, be born in 1918, and just keep repeating this forever.  For all she knows this could be her tenth time doing this.  I haven't seen this matter dealt with in the books.  Did I just miss it or something?
N Genuinely witty and fun.  I really liked the incorporation of the cartoon and quotations into the book, this made it more interesting and gave a better perspective on the chapters.  An uplifting read from beginning to end.
N For me, Wolfe's detailing of both the academic and social spheres at Dupont rang true.  As a student at a university driven by both scholarly research and the party scene, I can picture many of the novel's more dramatic scenes.  Some, like the Saint Ray party toward the beginning or the intimidating neuroscience lecture hall, I felt as if i were remembering rather than reading.   <br /> <br />No, there is no university quite like Dupont, succeeding in academics and sports at the highest levels.  If he had not given the school these characteristics, however, Wolfe might have put himself at a disadvantage:  There would be less of a chance for a reader to identify with the university, the characters, the scenes, and his commentary would have been limited to fewer aspects of today's campuses.  A novel about an UNDERachieving university might be interesting as well, but I think the scope of I Am Charlotte Simmons, and Dupont in particular, was well suited to Wolfe's acute powers of observation.
N This is a marvelous and beautifully realized work of fiction. As someone who enjoys mysteries, as well as historical fiction and gothic novels of suspense, I was quite taken with this book. Intricately plotted, the book is clever in its premise. Two disparate human beings, a highly independent, red-headed slip of a woman, Samantha Flood, Australian by birth, and a serious, fervently religious Spaniard, Miguel Madero, who is half-English, find themselves thrust together, as each explores the tiny, remote Cumbrian village of Illthwaite in England, looking for answers to their individual quests.  Both are in Illthwaite to get information relative to that which each is seeking. Both are staying in the local inn, called The Stranger House.<br /><br />Samantha is a brilliant but brash mathematician in her early twenties. Fondly known as Sam to her friends, she is interested in tracing her familial roots. She has recently discovered that her paternal grandmother was from this part of the world,  having been a part of a huge number of children migrants that had been unceremoniously shipped from England to other parts of its Empire, including Australia. Samantha is interested in finding out more about her paternal grandmother and the mystery surrounding her.<br /><br />Miguel, or Mig, as he is known to his family and friends, is the scion of a well-known house of vintners in Spain and is in his late twenties. He is a former seminarian who has suffered from manifestations of what he believes to be stigmata. He also, on occasion, sees ghostly manifestations or visions. Recovering from a serious alpine accident that nearly killed him, he is now in Illthwaite ostensibly to do research  for his thesis on the experience of English Catholics during the Reformation. He is, however, actually in Illthwaite to find out more about an ancestor of his who mysteriously disappeared there centuries ago during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I.<br /><br />In Illthwaite, Both Sam and Mig find themselves up against obstacles placed in their way. It seems that its residents are not totally forthcoming or are reluctant to part with information relative to their respective quests. What they each individually discover is that things are not always as they seem in Illthwaite.  Moreover, their divergent interests are more intertwined than they could ever have imagined. They will discover that they have more in common than they realized, having come full circle in a cosmic design not of their making.<br /><br />This book has well-drawn characters that come alive under the author's expert hand. The plot is unusual, as well as complex, containing many layers that the discerning reader will enjoy exploring. Well-written, as well as intricately plotted, this book crosses a number of genres. With its supernatural portents, historical underpinnings, underlying mystery, as well as its gothic type  suspense and sensibilities, infused with just a dollop of  romance, this book will appeal to those readers who favor these genres. In particular, I found the parts of the book that transcended into historical fiction to be the most compelling. This is not a book for everyone, but to  those for whom its themes have inherent appeal, it is a book to be relished.mselves up against obstacles placed in their way.

Y This is a marvelous read, and those already familiar with the Abel Jones series will not be disappointed.  Again, I am amazed and appreciative of the amount of research that Mr. Parry puts into his novels, and this book is a prime example.  It is a wonderful story that not only entertains, but also enlightens about one of the most important eras in our history, and, one of the most important cities and cultures (New Orleans) in our country.  I couldn't put it down and read it all in one sitting.  Thank again to the author, and I look forward to reading about how the venerable Abel Jones will come to grips with his latest personal struggle regarding family over duty!
N The premise of the book is hilarious: Dick and Jane, all grown up and still living in suburbia. But this isn't the suburbia of Ward and June Cleaver. It's the suburbia of \\"Desperate Housewives\\" with a Yiddish twist.<br /><br />It made me nostalgic for my years living in Miami Beach. Oy ve, where did the years go? Even the goyim who didn't grow up hearing Yiddish will love this book.
N This attractively illustrated book provides a showcase of Israel's achievements in fields as diverse as agriculture, education, medicine, science and technology. It looks at the technologies, processes and the products from this tiny little land that are improving the lives of so many people. The authors highlight some of the people responsible for this ingenuity that is benefiting the whole world.<br /><br />For example, at the Weizmann Institute, Dr Michal Schwartz has developed a way of harnessing immune system cells to repair and revive damaged nerve fibres. Other medical breakthroughs include the miniscule camera-in-a-tablet used for internal diagnosis, ultrasound for destroying tumours and Israel's highly effective disaster relief operations.<br /><br />A great help to third world people has been the discovery by scientist Yoel Margalith of the Bti bacterium that kills certain kinds of flies and harmful mosquitoes.  This has already saved millions of livers and is an environment-friendly intervention. Most remarkable is that Margalith is a holocaust survivor, of both the Bergen-Belsen and Teresienstadt camps.<br /><br />In many fields Israel is so far ahead of the pack that other countries have no chance of catching up. One of the most interesting innovations developed in Israel is a project to avoid collisions between aircraft and migratory birds. It involved the study of the flight paths of birds. This work of researcher Yossi Leshem is now also used by the Jordanian and Turkish air-force.<br /><br />Israel has more engineers per capita than any other country on earth and a remarkable number of hi-tech companies. Innovation in the fields of computers and information technology is particularly impressive. This encompasses software, operating systems, storage & retrieval systems, verification and firewall technologies, plus a host of mobile phone applications.<br /><br />Israel's creativity is not restricted to science and technology, as there is also much happening in arts and culture. Despite its small size and its many enemies, this country is bursting with creative energy and making a huge contribution to the global marketplace and to quality of life worldwide.<br /><br />The founders of this brave country were aware that Israel had almost no natural resources and that its people therefore had to develop and apply their brainpower. Well, they are succeeding spectacularly. What a pity that Israel has to devote so much of its money and resources to protect itself from its neighbours! If its full genius were given free reign, it would become even more of a blessing to the world.ts small size and its many enemies, this country is bursting with creative energy and making a huge contribution to the global marketplace and to quality of life worldwide.

N \\"Last Chance to See\\" is Douglas Adams' hilarious and though-provoking non-fiction, eco-travel narrative about circling the globe in search of some of the Earth's most endangered animals. We get to see a side of Adams that is deeply concerned with the plight of the beautiful, unique, and often ludicrously implausible lifeforms on our planet -- the same side that prompted him to climb Mount Kilimanjaro in a rhino suit.     What made this book all the more meaningful to me was that I'd thought I'd finished all of Douglas Adams' books long ago. I loved them all, but I never fully appreciated the depth of his genius as a humanist and social satirist until, sadly, he had passed away.  What's more, I never realized how much Adams' writings meant to me until I was hit with the cold, hard reality that he'd written all he ever would.  Douglas Adams had hitched his last ride across the galaxy, and I'd never hear from him again.  Or so I thought.    Infinitely improbable as it may seem, I heard from Douglas Adams again about two weeks ago.  I was browsing around in Borders, long since resigned to the fact that I'd read the last \\"new\\" Douglas Adams book I ever would, when I stumbled upon \\"Last Chance to See.\\" I felt like I'd gone into the pet store to buy a parakeet and, instead, found a dodo bird.      The endangered species Douglas Adams criss-crossed the globe in search of are all, in their own ways, remarkable and priceless. He urges us not to wait until they're gone to fully appreciate them, and he drives this point home to today's readers, in his own ironic style, by now being himself \\"extinct.\\"    If you're a Douglas Adams fan, and you've never read this book, here it is -- your own \\"last chance to see\\" (or, rather, read) him.  His own voice, his own words, his own experiences.  For me, it was a fond farewell from an old friend I'd never met, who, from his new home -- far beyond life, the universe, and everything -- telling me, \\"Yes, I'm dead. But there are still a few rhinos and gorillas and dolphins that aren't. Do me a favor; make sure they stay that way.\\"
N I really enjoyed the humor and visual scenes about Botswana in this book.
N The issue with opinion like his is that atheism is easy. IN complete arrogance any 8th grader can clearly refute the possibilites of the scriptures using 8th grade science! <br /> <br />What Earl misses is the basis for all believers.  <br /> <br />                      \\"Faith\\" <br /> <br />Scientists have no faith seeking earthy proof. The ultimate arrogance is the man who can refute the smallest evidance of something he does not understand. Something that requires \\"faith\\" above all.  <br /> <br />Without faith this book is just as moot as the book by Sobel. Without faith. Neither is relavant. <br /> <br />Tom B
N In a not too distant future, Angel is a certified Retribution Specialist (CRS), which means that when the law fails to bring justice, the victims can hire a CRS to bring in the perpetrator of the crime to them to enact their own justice.  When a closed case is reopened, Angel is again under investigation for \\"what happened\\" the night policeman Danny Black died.  On top of dealing with this, her mother, Lola, gets kidnapped, and Angel knows that if she doesn't rescue Lola herself, she might die. <br /> <br />Because she has Detective Marco following her and questioning her movements - from the past as well as during the events he witnesses personally, she starts finding things out about herself she really didn't want to know...like her exceptionally good luck.  It may not be luck after all; the physic abilities Lola has may actually be genuine and she inherited them.  <br /> <br />KISS OF THE BLUE DRAGON is the second story I've read by Julie Beard, and I actually like her writing style better here.  The story is written in first person, which can drive readers batty (me too upon occasion); however, it works here.  There is a different \\"feel\\" to KISS completely.  For me, I can \\"hear\\" a narrator filling in the details of Angels' activities.  So even though we, as a reader, only get to know her thoughts and impressions of what she sees, we still get to know what is going on around her.  You get to know Angel, what motivates her and see how she thinks very well.  I also really liked the fact that a lot of simple details of her life are included. <br />  <br />I will admit it was a close call as to whether I would like Angel or not.  She almost doesn't seem feminine.  However, if you read a little further into the book, you learn what her logic is, how she thinks but more importantly WHY.  Angel is tough, spunky, kick-butt heroine and out to help those unable to help themselves.  She is fearless and makes her decisions based on what is right rather than whether she willget hurt or not.  Angel is one busy lady.  She has cases that she maintains during the process of rescuing Lola and I liked the fact that Julie Beard didn't drop some of these issues, therefore the story stays three dimensional.   <br /> <br />While the reopened investigation is secondary to what is going on in her life, it is what brings our hero and heroine together.  I was happy with the chemistry between her and Detective Marco even if the bedroom scenes take place off of the books pages.   <br /> <br />I like the fact that even though KISS is a science-fiction romance, the author doesn't go out of her way to create objects that will stump the reader, or throw off the flow of the novel.  For an example: in a time where DNA left behind is what would keep you in jail, rather than using a hollow-tip bullet, a criminal would use a bullet filled with acid therefore destroying the evidence.   <br /> <br />KISS is technically supposed to be a romance, but with the way this story ends, we don't have our heroine hooking up with the hero.  Because Lola was kidnapped by one of the Chicago mobs there are still some unresolved issues that its sequel might wrap up.  Regardless, I didn't feel like major details were left out or the story wasn't well developed.  As a reader I didn't find myself wondering, \\"what just happened\\"?   <br /> <br />I found KISS OF THE BLUE DRAGON very interesting, and look forward to reading the further adventures of Angel in its sequel TOUCH OF THE WHITE TIGER.  So, if you are looking for something a little different, check out this story!
Y National Geographic Traveler is the best series of its type, and the NGT Thailand book has the same standards of quality as all the others.  It provides an excellent mix of written descriptions and beautiful pictures, both of which are helpful in determining whether to include places on your trip itinerary.  The only flaw is that the hotel and meal section is not particularly useful.
N Isabella Zophie & Le Cirque de Magique is an excellent book. I would say that it is one of the best books that I have ever read. It is very exciting and I enjoyed the mystery that was in the story. This is one of the most adventurous books that I have ever read.  <br /> <br />This book is about a ten year old girl, Isabella Zophie, who finds the Locket of Fire and Water in her great aunt's house and when she puts it on she is transported to another world - Zartarbia. She meets a circus which has lots of great characters including Mr Krock O'Dile who is a crocodile that runs the circus.  Isabella is chased by one of the syndicate, Mistress Sectica.  The Syndicate are a group of villains who are trying to control Zartarbia.  Fighting against the syndicate is the Federation Against Dark Forces (FADF) with agents trained in some of the coolest fighting techniques.   <br /> <br />Zartarbia is a magical world where nothing is as it seems. There is a crazy character called the Thinker who is a complete lunatic and very funny.  The first chapter is a bit confusing but you need to keep reading as it is important for later in the book.  <br /> <br />I think that all genders will like this book. Some parts in this book are very funny. If you are interested in fantasy and adventure, then you will enjoy this book.  <br /> <br />I would recommend this book to anyone.  <br />
N Being new to Sharepoint and webparts, I found this book to be concise and to-the-point. Guides you through basic webpart development in C# (when you register the book you can get code in VB if you desire). The book also discusses in straightforward terms debugging, deployment of webparts, code access security, targeting audiences and personalizing content. Plus it is only 175 pages, so it won't collapse your bookshelf.
N First,  the author is not a \\"cad\\".  He is too ugly and broke to be able to seduce women and leave them feeling used.  I got this book from the library because as a single gal I thought that I would learn something about men,  the kind who charm,  seduce,  and destroy.  Well,  what I learned is that Rick Marin is just a talentless guy trying to pass himself off as an intropesctive writer-wannabe poser.  It's amazing that Marin got any girls to date him taking into consideration how cold and judgmental he is. Reading his book was like watching a car accident--you know it's better to control yourself but you keeping looking to see the blood and guts.  Well,  this book just shows that this guy,  who has really nothing special,  or even redeemable,  is striving to be funny, intellectual, and show the male perspective on dating. He comes off really shallow,  superficial,  and as though he doesn't care which girl he's with as long as he's not alone.  Read it for yourself--Marin has nothing new or interesting to write. In this day and age,  anyone can publish regardless of whether or not the writer has anything significant to write about.
N Grant and Twain is a good book, informative, insightful, and concise enough.  <br /> <br />Mark Perry starts by giving us very good sketches of the lives of the two principals up to the point of the story, including some surprising (for me) details about their personal lives.  He then goes into their relationship, how it came to be, and the affect it had on their great works of literature. The books influenced by their time together, Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and Grant's Personal Memoirs, are considered to be classics and the best that either of the authors ever produced.  In fact, some think that Huckleberry Finn is the best American novel ever, and that Personal Memoirs (about the Mexican and Civil Wars) is the best American book ever written on military events.   Perry records many conversations Grant and Twain had with each other and with the other folks surrounding them, including families and associates.  It makes you feel like you are there, and gives some personal insight into what these gentlemen were really like. We find that they were both quite remarkable as private figures as well as public figures. The story of their relationship rides to a great extent on the heroic drama of Grant racing to finish his book before dying of cancer, to ensure the financial security of his family.  Perry, at the same time, paints a fascinating sketch of what Twain called the Gilded Age, a time of great industrial progress along with great corruption in the U.S. <br /> <br />It was a thoroughly enjoyable read. <br />
N \\"Truth vs Falsehood\\" is Hawkins' 4th book. In my mind, it is his greatest gift yet, but not in the sense that one might think. This will be explained in the closing. I will also preface by saying that I am in no way political. Truth is all that I am interested in. <br />   In Hawkins' previous 3 books, the kinesiological response was portrayed as infallible. His language was very absolute in its tone, giving the technique more credibility than it has ever received. Being so absolute with one's tone was the first obvious clue. When one becomes absolute in their tone, they often put an inordinate amount of faith in something outside themselves and overlook the inherent limitations. This is true for everything from religious absolutism to the mythical cure-all in medicine. The person who uses the absolute tone acts as if your salvation lies with this one particular thing.  <br />   I am a traditional naturopath. I was using kinesiology before Hawkins' books, and I am closely connected to practitioners of kinesiology who've used it in excess of 20 years. An observant and curious practitioner quickly realizes that the intent of both the testee and tester influences response. In some cases, a strong-willed practitioner who thinks he knows the cause of imbalance or dis-ease is affecting testee response and in essence using kinesiology to validate his own opinions and beliefs, albeit unknowingly. He will get the positive response he desires, whereas the practitioner with no vested interest in anything except the truth will get a different response on the same testee.  <br />   It has been difficult for me to bridge the gap between Hawkins' theory/ doctoral thesis on his use of kinesiology and the understanding that most experienced practitioners of kinesiology have. Nearly all experienced practitioners simply don't find the technique to be infallible. Certain criteria must be met for accurate response. Those criteria are training, impartiality, and the sincere and humble desire to put absolute truth above all things. Truth is absolute, but the technique is not. Remaining neutral is an ongoing challenge for the practitioner. <br /> <br />   I am not familiar with the testing methods used for Hawkins' doctoral thesis \\"Quantitative and Qualitative Calibration of the Levels of Consciousness\\". However, for it to withstand any scientific scrutiny, both the tester and testee would have to be without any knowledge on the subject matter. There would also have to be at least 20 different testers for the 3000+ test subjects, with each tester coming up with their own test responses to a given list of questions. Responses would not be compared until all testers have compiled their findings. For his thesis, something along these lines was most likely used.  <br />   Throughout \\"Power vs. Force\\", a healthy skepticism was maintained towards Hawkins putting so much faith in this technique. Part of this was based on an inability to get the same responses he was getting. The information presented in \\"The Eye of the I\\" and \\"I\\" was absolutely astounding, and skepticism was temporarily set aside. Apparently, his intent was pure and sincere enough to allow him to experience absolute truth on spiritual inquiry. Much of this can be attributed to his description of a life-changing experience. He was atheist (or possibly agnostic... don't remember which), hit a major crisis in his life, and finally called out in total humility to be shown the truth of God. I feel his pure intent allowed him to access the truth he did. <br />   However, once Hawkins gained confidence in the technique, he apparently fell into the trap of thinking he could divorce himself from influencing response. The methods used for gleaning the information found in \\"Truth vs Falsehood\\" would surely not withstand any scientific scrutiny. The simple fact that the subject matter was familiar to the tester(s) and testee(s) disqualifies it. Asking about the nature of life, death, and other unknown spiritual matters is not the same as asking about one's perceived reality, which one already has strong opinions and emotions about and attachments to. Both testers and testees would have to be completely unfamiliar with the line of inquiry to have any guarantee of neutrality. <br /> <br />   Within 30 seconds of opening \\"Truth vs Falsehood\\", it was clear something wasn't right. Hawkins' 3 previous books have helped us to discern truth from falsehood more clearly. Many of us have reached a place where now we `just know' the truth. It is often a clear gut feeling, and at that point the kinesiological response seems unnecessary. In a way, it turns out the technique was only a tool to guide us to our own inner knowing.  <br />   Hawkins acknowledges the existence of ignorance and untruth, but does not address the issue of deliberate deception. It is ironic that after years of devotion to the truth, Hawkins still does not fully grasp the nature of deception. The world citizenry is currently experiencing one of the most elaborate mass brainwashes in history.  <br />   In fact, Hawkins even engages in deception when he explains the Iraq situation. He indicates that the primary reason to be there is to protect the world's (and specifically America's) economic and oil interests. Yet the primary reason given to the public for going to war was weapons of mass destruction. Whether or not it was a fact that there were actually WMDs misses the point. It was given as the main reason, and it was not. That is deception. For Hawkins to agree with the idea of justifiable deceptions is a clear indicator that he is not neutral here. <br />   More importantly, for Hawkins to act as if outright deception is not occurring speaks to one's ability to deal with reality. For a person with 80 years of conditioned perception of reality to have reality turned on its head, a person could have a serious breakdown. <br /> <br />   The gift in this 4th book is that Hawkins has shown us what thekinesiological technique can and cannot be used for. It can be used by the sincere truthseeker for his/herself. However, it is not to be used to show one a reality they are not ready to see. There is no technique to make one see the truth. One's clear and sincere intention is all that can do that. And even then, one may not be ready to handle the fullness of reality. The process of how one \\"wakes up\\" is yet to be known. <br />   Who better than Hawkins to show us that experience is no substitute for impartiality? So, the readers of his 4th book get the opportunity to discern what is truth and what is his belief. The first 3 books prepared us, and the 4th is the test. Although he didn't intend it to work this way, it is the greatest gift of all. And just as importantly, it shows us that one can be quite enlightened in one area, while not having it all together in another. Even when one crosses the 600 line, one is still assailed by falsity and ignorance and must be constantly vigilant and unattached to one's beliefs.  <br /> <br />   And realistically, it couldn't have happened any other way. Given Hawkins' first 3 books and his audience, if he gave us the absolute truth about all the deceptions that make up the current perceived reality, it could have seriously messed some people up. It could result in serious mental breakdown if it was said that there aren't actually arab terrorists creating terror in America. So, the book had to be presented this way. And those of us who know the real truth know it through our own inner knowing already and don't need Hawkins to tell us. <br />   In `The Art of War', Sun Tzu said, \\"All warfare is based on deception.\\" Well, currently we have warfare in nearly every form. Even `necessary' and `justified' wars have deception as their roots. <br /> <br />Michael <br />Santa Fe, New Mexico
N I enjoyed the comments of the preceding which told me much about the book in my conteplation of purchasing it. Lucent's down fall started with the 1984 decree. Something that AT&T embraced thinking that new and bigger markets would be available. Missteps included buying TCI cable without the experience and knowledge of running a mom and pop business on the run far from \\"Bell Standards\\" that so many Western Electric and Lucent Managers embraced. They did not change into the flexible and savy business men of the 80s and 90s and lost at every turn and decission. The \\"Early Outs\\" prior to 1991 took most of the business knowledge and stability with them. Managers and CEOs were hired from all differnt kinds of Companies having differnt values and business understandings (which was needed) but lacked fundamental telecommunications expertise and how to gain a lion's share of the market. The best method was new technologies coupled with listening to all the customers needs and concerns. Lucent, like its predecessor and parent company, devalued it's stock and undevalued it's once talented, dedicated and loyal workforce. The Book seems like a good purchase but it doesn't seem to touch upon the employees who built it and subsequently were forced to see it go. Bell Labs and the Bell System literally dictated to the Baby Bells that analog equipment would continue to be used in the late 70s. Digital technology had been introduced by various venders and Bell Labs played \\"catch up\\" when the operating companies began buying the digital equipment fron non Western Electric sources. That was the first mis-step of Western Electric....Lucent Technologies management. Understand the marketplace and the needs of your customer...always. R. Ferry...27 years with Western Electric.
Y It is to Jane Hyun's credit to discuss issues of Asian American professionals on a very practical level. There are however, some caveats for the reader. The book needs to be contextualized within a larger conceptual framework. The overarching issues are ignored within her practical framework, namely: Who needs to change? Who needs to accommodate whom?  How much? What are the risks and benefits? Her book appears to be saying that corporate America needs to understand Asians, but it does not need to change.  Rather it is the Asian professional that needs to change and adapt. <br /> <br />Is the book too heavily assimilationist?  It is not clear as Hyun does make a distinction early in her book between assimilation (\\"adopting ...at the expense of one's own cultural characteristics\\") and acculturation (\\"adapting ...while continuing to maintain values, perspectives, and features of one's native culture\\"). <br /> <br />There appears to be little adaptation of any Asian models or perspective to the mainstream USA corporate culture -- page 279 suggests two ways: \\"Develop cultural competency\\" and \\"Make use of your bicultural and bilingual abilities.\\" While recognizing the dominance of USA/Western research and models in the business world, it is also logical and no \\"one model fits all.\\" Perhaps future research and practices can provide indigenous Asian models or perspectives that can be adapted and work effectively in coporate America or other cultures.  The Special Issue on China & India (Business Week, August 22/29, 2005) points out how some USA business models are not applicable. <br /> <br />It is not an either/or proposition.  By utilizing the juxtaposition of the Asian behavior/values system versus the Western behavior/values system to present her central thesis, Hyun creates a false dichotomy in the mind of the reader. Current business literature is filled with exhortations of \\"win/win,\\" \\"both/and,\\" \\"alignment,\\" and \\"interdependence\\" -- all very Asian concepts. These traditional Asian cultural values are at the very heart of what contemporary corporate America is trying to effect in order to add value. So there is a \\"baby with the bath water\\" caveat here to the reader.  The accommodation needs to be reciprocal, not unilateral. <br /> <br />In her Epilogue, Hyun encourages the reader to \\"Develop an Action Plan That Works with Your Persona.\\"  It seems throughout her book that the emphasis is on asking the reader to tailor his or her persona to that which is required for success in corporate America, not on utilizing the behavioral strengths and cognitive positions with which someone who comes with a strong Asian cultural background is imbued.  Being Asian -- it seems to Hyun -- puts one in a deficit position. <br /> <br />The reader needs to be cautious in the self-assessment, individual profiles, exercises and tools cited. They yield helpful descriptive self-awareness profiles and information, not diagnostic or predictive profiles, and they are dependent on situational factors. There are many suggestions, based perhaps on many years of experience, but empirical data demonstrating their reliability, validity or efficacy are not mentioned. <br /> <br />Kudos to Hyun for encouraging the seeking of regular and frequent performance feedback. This is a career self-monitoring technique that is utilized far too little by all employees to help document and strengthen requests for job and salary advancement.  In spite of the conceptual conundrums, this highly practical book is a must read. <br /> <br />Adrian Chan (Kochman Mavrelis Associates, Oak Park, IL) & Barry Mar (Management & Resources Associates, Seattle, WA) <br />
N Dobson begins her easy-to-read book with chapters appropriately titled \\"Helping Your Child Love Learning\\" and \\"Creating Your Own Educational Reform\\". After reading just these two chapters I was already in love with the book.<br /><br />The remaining chapters consist of reader contributed ideas, lessons and games. These parents know how to make education so fun the kids probably won't even know they are learning! The ideas are easy, fast, inexpensive, and usually involve minimal research.<br /><br />What really makes this book stand far and above others is Table 2.2, found on pages 34-37. This helpful table lists many popular off-the-shelf curriculums that can be easily recreated at home with materials you already have, or can be found used - all for under $100!<br /><br />This book is truly ingenious! It's about time someone organized the ideas of creative parents into one handy reference. I cannot think of a better person to present this material other a personal favorite, Linda Dobson.
N I started the series with Winter House and am now back tracking to the beginning.  I enjoyed this book as much as Winter House and can't wait to start the next one in the series.
N I've read almost every book written on the Beatles and found Cynthia's story poignant and from the heart.  She's had a hard time finding her true self in the shadows of her larger-than-life men and marriages and she persists despite the setbacks and enjoys the adventures. <br /> <br />The first half of the book is almost identical to her earlier book, Twist of Lennon in 1989.  I've not read much about her or Julian from 1980 on and it is interesting to look at behind-the-scenes reflections vs. what the public sees.  Julian: Sing again in your own key and forget about Them. <br /> <br />If you are a '42-years And Counting' Beatles fan like me, then  you will enjoy this book.  There are some unreleased pictues you'll relish from Cyn's family album. <br /> <br />All You Need Is Love, oh yeah, yet there wuz a lot of hurtin' souls along Penny Lane besides Eleanor Rigby or Sgt. Pepper. The price of fame which is not fleeting here. <br /> <br />Donna Coulson
N I have searched and searched for a great Arthurian retelling and have been disappointed with the ones I have ventured into reading. I was somewhat skeptical when I picked up Nancy McKenzie's Queen of Camelot. This two-novels-in-one compilation is based on Guenevere, from her point of view, in first person narrative, and is 623 pages long in very small print. I didn't want to waste my time reading something this big only to be disappointed at the end. I nevertheless gave the book a whirl. Glad I did! This is one of the most compelling and beautifully told retells I have ever read! McKenzie gives us a detailed story about Guenevere from her point of view. She tells us about the prophecy on the day she was born, how she spends her childhood as an adventurous tomboy, how people fear her and treat her differently as she grows up, how the knights around her battle with the Saxons, and how all of the prophecies come true. She meets Arthur, marries him and later has a love affair with Lancelot, something based on the original tale. But the novel has so much more than that. You will see how this story of magic, prophecies, love and betrayal transpires in an altered, detailed and beautiful light. There are many twists throughout the novel.<br /><br />Guenevere is developed in such an abundant, three-dimensional way in this novel. She is no longer just the pagan beauty who marries a Christian, betrays him and destroys all of Camelot as a result. She is a complex character with flaws as well as virtues in this offering. Arthur is also written in a more interesting, compelling way here, but it is Lancelot that once again blows me away. I have always romanticized Sir Lancelot and McKenzie does not disappoint me in her version of the loyal, chivalrous knight. Merlin and Morgan Le Fay are written with much complexity and nuance as well. This novel, however, does not focus so much on the love triangle between Guenevere, Arthur and Lancelot as much as her inability to supply an heir for Arthur and her affection for Arthur's bastard son, the traitorous Mordred. The overall story is magnificent. Once again, I say that McKenzie did a wonderful job bringing Guenevere to life. She turns this character into a strong, intelligent, complex, three-dimensional, flesh and blood woman, someone you will feel a great deal of affinity with. She is not portrayed as a simple-minded, traitorous hussy in this one! I loved the fanciful storytelling style that made me turn the pages until the wee hours of the night. Some of my friends who read the book along with me complained about it being too long-winded. I didn't think it was long-winded at all. In fact, I wish it had been longer. I loved this book and I look forward to giving Grail Prince a whirl.for Arthur and her affection for Arthur's bastard son, the traitorous Mordred. The overall story is magnificent.

N This author will be on the Coast2Coast radio show tonight 10/13/05 at 10PM PT. I will do a review at that time. Yes, I've read the book, but I need to ask him some questions before I rate this one folks. This is one of those books that will stir you up, make you ask questions, and allow you to accept the answers. My review will be posted after the George Noory interview...
N By the time we get to \\"Guardsman of Gor,\\" the 15th of John Norman's Counter-Earth novels, we are clearly in a transitional period.  I did not like the idea that instead of Tarl Cabot we were now telling the story of a different Earth man who ends up on Gor, although the Jason Marshall trilogy was more interesting to me than the story of Judy Thornton, a woman brought to Gor as a captive in \\"Slave Girl of Gor.\\"  In the first volume of the trilogy, \\"Fighting Slave of Gor,\\" Marshall ends up on Gor when he tries to save Beverly Henderson from a Gorean slave trap.  The next thing the civilized Earth man knows he is a slave on Gor.  Starting out as the silk slave of the Lady Florence of Vonda, Marshall then becomes a Gorean gladiator, which gives him the opportunity to become free so that he can find Beverly, who now also a slave on Gor.<br /><br />\\"Rogue of Gor\\" is the middle volume in the trilogy and the novel and has Marshall searching for Beverly.  But since this is a trilogy you know that he is not going to find her until the final volume, \\"Guardsman of Gor.\\"  Instead, Marshall travels along the River Vosk to the port city of Victoria, north of Port Kar, and finds himself in the middle of a war between Glorious Ar and the Salerian Confederation as the pirate fleet seeks to control the waterways of Gor on which the cities are so dependent.  In terms of providing more action than sex, this is the one volume of the trilogy that delivers on that score and if you are waiting for Jason and Beverly to consummate their relationship in Gorean terms you have the last half of the next novel for all of that to play out (after a giant naval battle).  In this one he finds her on the slaver's block, buys her, and sets her free even though she insists she is a true slave and therefore does not desire freedom.<br /><br />There is a sense in which Norman is trying to get back to the basics, since the fight between Ar and the Salerian Confederation is not, at face value, part of the gigantic struggle between the Priest-Kings and the Kurii.  But the sexual philosophy of Gor is now becoming the dominant theme of Norman's stories.  The back of the original paperback declares, \\"Jason Marshall learned the meaning of manhood and the power of women, both dominant and submissive\\" on Gor, but clearly he has yet to fully accept his role in this society.  This time around Norman is educating a male rather than a female, which is usually the case in the Gor novels, and I think that you have to take such instruction at face value.<br /><br />The obvious assumption might be that most men would not need to be persuaded to live a life being a master, but when you consider the discussion that Jason and Beverly were having at the start of the trilogy before they ended up on Gor you have to admit that it is not exactly the sort of lifestyle to which a \\"civilized\\" man would aspire.  Clearly Norman is arguing men have to be carefully taught such beliefs almost as much as women, although you will never convince me the male of the species would require as much persuasion.  Consequently, whether you judge \\"Rogue of Gor\\" by the standard of either the best Gor adventures (\\"Nomads of Gor\\" and \\"Assassins of Gor\\") or the main testaments of Gorean sexuality (\\"Slave Girl of Gor,\\" \\"Kajira of Gor,\\" and \\"Dancing Girl of Gor\\"), it falls short.  For the most part only true believers are going to proceed beyond this trilogy to complete the series.he gigantic struggle between the Priest-Kings and the Kurii.

N Prior to reading this book, I didn't think I had major limiting beliefs but the exercises that Cole-Whittaker takes you through helped me uncover some I hadn't even realized I had. <br /> <br />If something has kept you from reaching your potential and you can't quite figure out what, pick up this book and uncover your personal obstacles. <br /> <br />Cole-Whittaker is a minister and does refer to God often in the book. If that bothers you, try to figure out a way to get around the references because this book may do wonders for you. I personally subscribe to the Higher Power so it was fine with me.
N Terry McMillan's characters are real, alive and easy to relate to. I appreciate her writing because it speaks to your heart and helps you understand yourself and others. This book is a must read because it is not filled with flashy clichs but still grabs and keeps your attention until the very end. But It!
N very informative on various aspects of astrology ranging from generalities about signs to history of the signs. i was highly interesting and is a great informative tool for a light reading of your sign and a more extensive one.
N I was hoping that the book would be better than the television show, and it wasn't. The show, with its amusing quips, puns and overreaching pseudointellectual analyses of female behavior, is entertaining in a vegetative sort of way. The book should have had more depth. Yes, I'm sure there are women in NYC who claim to be looking for love as they hop from bed to bed hoping to change men into what they want. I hope to high Heaven that the denizens of real NYC are nothing like the flaky women in Candace Bushnell's Sex In The City. Mr. Big is just as egregious in the book as he's portrayed in the HBO show. On the plus side, Patricial Field does a great job with Carrie's wardrobe on the show.
Y Champlin bravely asserts his own contribution to the great wealth of Neronian scholarship for the critics to pick apart. I find very little to quibble about.<br />It is difficult to write even-handedly about Nero for a Western audience. Who could forget the image of a man who \\"fiddled while Rome burned\\" or the terrible tyrant who had begun a nearly 170 year \\"persecution\\" of the early Christians, under whose reign both Peter and Paul were executed? As other reviewer comments reveal, you can easily earn the brand of a Nero \\"apologist\\" if you don't tow the party line, however inaccurate it might be.<br /><br />Champlin's thesis can be stated simply as follows: many, if not most of Nero's grandstands and outrageous actions, were performed out of considerable political shrewdness and calculation - not the madness or puerile excess wrongly attributed to a \\"live fast, die young, and leave a good looking corpse\\" emperor. Nero's success, Champlin argues in the first chapter, is evinced by a shockingly prolonged \\"afterlife\\" manifested in pseudo-Neros, Judeo-Christian apocalyptic writings, and a disenfranchised populace openly lamenting his death. Nonetheless, I cannot help but wonder, (working on the same assumption,) whether he had truly orchestrated his public relations as well as Champlin suggests given his untimely demise at age 30.<br /><br />Some reviewers disagree, but I reckon Champlin's original Nero-Periander link to be one of the most intriguing ideas in ancient biography I've ever seen. The ambivalent relationship with the mother, the Philhellenism, the artistic bent, and the numerous other links are too compelling to ignore outright, even if the conclusion a hard sell. Further research is warranted, but I suspect that Champlin, with his great intellect and energy, may have already exhausted all of the available evidence for advancing his thesis. He demonstrates the Augustus/Antony connections thoroughly. The discussion of the great fire of 64 is arrestingly well done: after convincingly presenting the defense for Nero's innocence, he suddenly shatters the deception in stating that despite this preceding evidence, Nero undoubtedly held direct responsibility for the coflagration. It hits you with dramatic effect almost equal to one of the primary sources comprising the centerpiece of his proof in this sudden reversal: Tacitus' Annales XV.67.<br /><br />Champlin's organization is somewhat bothersome as it is in \\"Final Judgments,\\" because he rejects chronological arrangement for thematic foci. This requires repetition of several facts, and I cannot understand his reasons for the chapter order. The post-mortem legacy of Nero, being most fascinating, he puts up front obviously to hook his reader. It serves as an interesting set piece for further discourse, because the inevitable wonder we feel about Nero's impression on the world ever after demands explanation: thus the rest of the book. But with Dio, Suetonius, and Tacitus unfolding the bulk of their own histories so methodically, the rearrangement isn't always a neat fit. Still, Champlin's brilliant weaving together of hundreds of sources, as before, vindicates his literary decisions several times over.<br /><br />Champlin, like any other historian, has his hypotheses and directs his evidence toward proving them. His presentation however, is replete with past scholarship and primary sources presented candidly and fairly. One of the most appreciable inclusions is the extensive collection of Latin graffiti, which add a critical dimension to our knowledge. This book has been for me an introduction into full-strength Neronian scholarship and I found it both accessible and empowering enough to read further with confidence.ngly presenting the defense for Nero's innocence, he suddenly shatters the deception in stating that despite this preceding evidence, Nero undoubtedly held direct responsibility for the coflagration.

N While I don't always agree with his TV analysis, I enjoy Mr. Crawford's commentaries. His book, however, is surprisingly shallow and can be summed up in one chapter with footnotes. I didn't realize an intentional misquoting of Thomas Jefferson on page 2 (easy enough to catch as the footnote provides the actual quote) was a foreshadowing of the paraphrasing to come. Almost all his sources are the very media he criticizes.    Yes, the media should be astute and critical of anyone in power anywhere, yet it isn't, mostly because it has been corporatized. vilified and because reporters and organizations have wimped out. OK, yes, and....?     Since Crawford is a journalist, one who claims an inside view of what really goes on, he is obligated by the same standards he poses not just to say this is what went on, but to explain why manipulation is allowed and what to do about it. Tom Fenton in his book, Bad News, does a more thorough job of explaining the links between money and reporting and providing a context for media manipulation and journalistic reticence.     Crawford gives specific examples of manipulation, but doesn't provide motive or context beyond the trite \\"politicians manipulate the media so they can look better so they can become powerful.\\" Therein lies the point, if the media is powerful enough that it needs to be manipulated, then it is powerful enough to hold its own. Why hasn't the media held its own and why aren't people demanding a real public discussion? What does the messenger do with the message he was supposed to deliver?    Crawford says people are tuning to outlets to verify their beliefs so news outlets are becoming customer-driven reinforcing agents. If that's true, why is the media making that choice instead of taking the lead? Politicians do attack the messenger, but often they don't have to, because the messenger has been co-opted. More dangerously, by giving hyperbole public time and space, the news media cuts its own throat then calls it a tracheotomy.    Still, despite the flaws, I stayed with the book's limited scope until page 117. \\"I don't vote....\\" With that, Crawford's credibility flew out the window.     \\"I fear it will make it more difficult to keep my observations down the middle.\\" After 116 pages of caterwalling about professional and personal responsibility, about the consequences to democracy of a media manipulated by power, about how the media is responsible to its constituents, the public, and should judge both the quality and importance of its \\"message,\\" Crawford absolves himself of any duty, responsibility or personal judgment. His book becomes a version of \\"do as I say, not as I do.\\" Worse yet, the core of his argument is a tautology: journalists must give up the rights and responsibilities of citizenship to uphold the rights and responsibilitites of citizenship. Talk about attacking the messenger, the messenger just committed suicide.     Come on, get in the muck with the rest of us, make tough decisions, make judgments. It's in the choosing that one gains perspective and insight. Not voting because you're a journalist is like saying a Yankee fan can't write about baseball or deciding not to eat anything, ever, so no one will know you don't like brocolli.    As Jim Hightower put it, \\"There ain't nothin' in the middle of the road but yellow stripes and dead armadillos.\\"
N Mr. Andersons' book provides a thorough examination, diagnosis, and best possible cure for what ails black america. Not poor whites, hispanics, arabs, jews, gays, or white women.

N For the operaholics among us (I am one) \\"Fortissimo\\" is an entertaining and interesting look at what goes on backstage at the opera. Author Murray was given unprecedented access to Lyric Opera of Chicago's Opera Center for American Artists during the 2003-2004 season. This is Lyric Opera's training ground for young artists. Murray follows this group of twelve singers through coaching sessions, rehearsals, auditions and performances to give the reader a close-hand look at the rigorous intensity of this most glorious art form. Interspersed with this are chapthers which fill out the picture of what it takes to succeed in opera. There is a chapter devoted to the comprimario - singers who specialize in secondary characters. Another chapter is devoted to Pavarotti, a warning of what can happen when one achieves what Murray dubs 'sacred monster' status. A sacred monster, superstar, Pavarotti was undone at the end of his career by his enormous ego. This book is a wonderful gift for those opera lovers on your Christmas list this season.
N As far as Henry County (and all of central Indiana) ghost stories are concerned, this book is as comprehensive as I've ever seen. I was born and raised in Henry County, and still live here, and I have heard a lot of the stories going around. I've been to a lot of the sites mentioned. Ms. Perry did a wonderful job covering the history, both factual and reported. The grammatics and punctuation leave something to be desired, but it is nothing that hindered my enjoyment of these stories. <br /> <br />
Y This book has been fascinating to read. It is evident, as a student of comparative religion, that the author has done some careful research and integrated it successfully in the book. A lot has to be said for some major research flaws, such as often referring to Sufis (Islamic mystics) and Mosques, even though Islam wasn't to arrive for another 650 years! Overall, it is an entertaining book and will provide you with an interesting alternative for the life of Jesus, an alternative that is likely, not fictional.<br /><br />Enjoy, but do filter the content.
N THe book was good as always and Jim Dale consistently puts the emotion and voices to the book that creates a don't stop listening pleasure. Also a great price at amazon!!!
N Being a stalwart fan of the fantasy genre I decided to put my skepticism aside, break down and give these \\"children's\\" books a go. This series is in line with a lot of classic entertainment touted as \\"children's\\" fare (e.g., original Bugs Bunny cartoons, The Hobbit, Chronicles of Narnia, among others): that is, much of it is aimed straight at the heart of adults. And it hits the mark.    I have finished the series up to Book Five and I must say that there have been some pretty grisly incidents for younger readers. However, one can assume that many of Rowling's younger readers have followed the books from the beginning, and grown as Harry Potter did. For the younger readers just starting, however, along about book four some of the material may be a tad startling or disconcerting.    In any case, I have found the writing to be thoroughly entertaining, particularly the effective use of tongue-in-cheek humor. There is a comical brattiness about many of the characters (professors, parents, and students alike) which plays pretty well. The childishness of the main characters can be a bit trying at times, I will admit; but it is forgivable and understandable...they are, after all, still kids.    The use of suggestion and mystery -- of questions that do not get answered till the end of the book -- can also be a bit trying at times, but it is also compelling and intriguing at the same time, and part of this author's trademark.    All in all, these are exciting, fast-paced books, truly classics in their own time, and I am duly impressed that they lived up to their hype in my mind, skeptic that I was. Five stars, for cripe's sake.
N To high school and my best friend and her boyfriend. It was scary how realistic this book is. It's a beautiful love story that had me up all night reading, I finished it in one day. A true page turner, comedy and tear jerker. A real quick read. Buy It!
N It is a lovely book... somewhat surreal and definitely Utopian in theme but Bryant takes you so gently and slowly to her thesis that it's ultimately easy-to-swallow. Reflection over time, however, yields a few problems.  <br />As another reviewer has pointed out, Bryant uses a dispicable character to explain and augment the premise for the culture of Ata; many readers will find it hard to sympathize with his supposed enlightenment. Also, the id is completely glossed over in this book, the idea being that  proper socialization within such a  Utopian culture would erase or negate animalistic urges down to permanently manageable magnitude; many readers will question her conclusion in that regard and doubts will emerge on the entire premise. Lastly, the protagonists obtuse nature makes the book plod a bit; many readers will \\"get it\\" right away and be annoyed with how long it takes the main character to catch up (which in some respects he never really does) <br /> <br />Then there's the attitude of the Kin of Ata themselves. While beautiful and loving and empathic and yadda yadda, they can easily come across as lackadaisical or just plain apathetic. While much is made of their near-telepathic \\"oneness\\" and reliance upon their spiritual nature, their repeated indulgence of the main character becomes tiresome.... have they no self-preservation? No passion? No overriding discipline? These questions are best exemplified by the fact that the Ata see no benefit from the notion of the written word. Much is made of their connection to one another; their oral history that becomes the art of storytelling etc. Apparently, historical fact-keeping is anathema to Utopia. I found that notion to be impossible to accept. Within the framework of a people absolutely cut-off from \\"modern\\" societies influence perhaps that could MAYBE be true, but one does not simply dismiss an obstacle to spiritual awakening by pushing it out of view. This comes across as a basic ostrich manuever to avoid facing the difficult realities of human natures: heirarchical thinking, competiveness and basic surivival needs that when unmet turn to aggression and antagonistic behavior. Those may not be pleasant realities but they are realities. <br /> <br />For a more interesting (and possibly more intellectual) take on the same notion, try out Herland by Charlotte Perkins Gilman. Although her victorian attitudes about female sexuality date the piece, all other aspects of her Utopia seem more plausible to me. Which is saying something, really.  <br /> <br />Actually, I'd be more enthusiastic to recommend The Dispossessed (or nearly anything by Ursula K LeGuin) or Wild Seed (or nearly anything by Octavia Butler) as both (the books and the writers) explore the notion of a Utopian ideal by handing it to humanity via an alien race who are well aware of the not-so-nice aspects of human nature. Both writers understand that some unsavory elements are iron-clad stuck in us, not just taught to us.  <br /> <br />By keeping the Utopianists as human as anyone else, we beg the question \\"why do those humans never fight, never hurt each other and how would they deal with a natural disaster?\\" which never seems to be answered by Utopian writers adequately. By beginning enlightenment with an outside species/race, we change the question to \\"can humanity resist its negative tendancies in order to accept this Utopia?\\" which is imminently more interesting and quite possibly answerable on some level.  <br /> <br />The Kin of Ata... neither addresses nor firmly answers these questions, which is it's only flaw. For fantasy, however, it sure is a wonderful read.
N Assisted by my wife, I've been the editor of LaCad, the Cadillac LaSalle Club of Australia's magazine for three years, and we've used the Standard Catalog of Cadillac as our reference for those three years.  This issue tops the last issue by the inclusion of colour and even more photos. <br /> <br />Thanks to John Gunnell for this 'bible' of Cadillacs.
N There were times as I was reading this book that I cringed and thought to myself \\"How could she be so stupid.\\" But I had to remind myself of her tender age in this story. She did a lot of things at a young age that many of us may never do in our entire lifetime. Prostitution, Pimping and drugs. This book had so much purpose and that's why I call it \\"One of the best book that I read all year\\". It's written like a novel so it doesn't come off preachy or like a self help book. Maya Angelou tells a portion of her story. She uncovers layers of clothing and bares the naked truth of her young adulthood. To me this is not just a story of a black woman and a black womans struggles; this is a story about hard knocks and people of all races and nationalities experience them. \\"Rita\\" felt like she had to make her own way, she felt like she needed all of the answers at once. No one was going to take care of her and son.  And at the same time, while she felt the burdens of independence, she also felt the emptieness and lonlieness that we all feel some time or another just because we are human. \\"Rita\\" made a lot of poor decisions, but that's not the reason that we know her today. We don't know her because she was once a madam on the West Coast, or a prostitute in Stockton, or a cook in Oakland. We know her because she found God's plan for her life and stuck with it.
Y Although not quite what I expected, this book was far from being a disappointment.  It is not solely focused on women dressed as angels, it is mainly an erotic Fantasy Photography book.  9 photographers from North-central europe are featured, with more than 10 photographs from each.  Styles differ, from body-painting (for a comic-book effect) to completely photoshopped settings and landscapes, to a contortionist/dancer - but always the theme remains, the female in ways you probably have not seen before.
N This book is one of the few Action Script books that specifically covers Flash Communication Server.   Using this book I was able to build a chat server as well as a flash movie that could connect to it and have many clients interact with each other.  <br /> <br />Good Book!
N Rebeccasreads recommends REVENGE ON RAIRARUBIA for fans of Molly Doogan & Netty Parmet, & the fabled land of Rairarubia, about which the two girls write for a school project.  <br /> <br />You will be overjoyed at this new & exciting adventure in which Molly must return a mysterious giant bird egg they find in the ring of stones in Molly's bedroom, before it hatches. <br /> <br />In real life, only minutes pass between each book in this series, whereas on Rairarubia sometimes it's been years. So when Molly sees the egg beginning to crack, there's only one thing they can do, take it back from whence it came... except life has moved on in that fantastic world... where they find old friends & new enemies. <br /> <br />& this time the connection between real life & Rairarubia must be joined because Molly needs to bring her doctor mother to help friends survive a beastly plague.
N You learn by doing, not just reading. <br /> <br />There are around 600 bidding sequences and hands.  You make your bid and see what the author thinks.  He explains the strengths and weaknesses of some of the likely choices.  You learn how not to wrong side NT contracts (missing stoppers, or exposing pards stopper). <br /> <br />Not only is your knowledge of 2/1 bidding tested, but so is your judgement.  There may be 2 roughly equal bids available, and the author will explain why one is slightly better than the other. <br /> <br />The way to get the most out of the book is to keep a record of quizzes you got wrong, then come back to the book in 6 months and see how you do. <br /> <br />Note:  This book uses Mike Lawrences version of 2/1 not Max Hardys, so there are a few differences.
N The original book is great.  The book is large and the pictures are excellent colour. <br /> <br />The reprint is very disappointing.  The book is smaller, the colours are not as good, and some of the original images have actually been cropped so not all of them are correct anymore.  Suggest that the printer look at the original and reprint something of a similar standard.
N One of my favorite books.  A book that adults can enjoy while reading to their kids.
Y This book is a very good companion if you are using osteology blocks with pictures in black and white. Is just 32 pages and the information is limited, however the pictures are great and allow you to see the little details that escape from black and white photos in other books. Did I mention the price? Is very affordable for struggling students like me.
N The story started rather interestingly, describing the strangeness of the euphorism that Dr Perowne felt within himself.  It heightened the anticipation that something major (and perhaps unpleasant) was going to unfold in this man's life. The story however started to lose my attention when it delved into the details of the surgical operations Dr Perowne was almost reminiscing about.    There are of course twists and turns in the story and spots of brilliancy.  However, the ambitiousness that underlies the writing of this novel permeates almost every sentence in the story, as a result of the contrived manner in which the story was weaved together.  One cannot help but feel that the story was written in such a manner as to overwhelm, and therefore, impress, a reader by means of employing semmingly non-intricate sub-plots.  Such sub-plots are by no means undesirable.  It is however rather lamentable when one is unable to weave the sub-plots together skillfully, as in \\"Saturday\\".    The only saving grace of \\"Saturday\\" was the incredibly insightful and masterly description of a character's thoughts and emotions, almost right down to every second of thought or emotion that went through the character.  Indeed, it was written so well that it starts to make one wonder whether one is actually capable of so many thoughts and emotions per second.  And that can be a rather startling, perhaps even disturbing, thought.  It seems to insinuate that perhaps one doesn't actually know oneself as well as one had thought one does.    But this is not an issue for anyone to ponder over for another day, especially if at least 1 day of the week has already been spent on \\"Saturday\\".  Your time would be better employed pondering on the remains of the week.
N <br /> <br />Knife of Dreams was easily one of the best in the series, in my opinion.  If you are more of a fast-paced person, this story just isn't for you. I'm the sort of person that ends up underlining bits in my paperbacks and waking up in the middle of the night to see how something was worded.  I owe Jordan a lot. I started reading Eye of the World a couple years ago and my own writing moved from really sucking to only mild suckage. If I could read all of the 8,000 pages I've heard are first presented for editing for each book, I would. I recommend reading each book twice. Once to read it over and know the plot, and the second time should be thorough to the point of anal-ness. This prepares you for discussion with the other members of our breed. <br /> <br />On the actual specific book. . . . <br />Overall, the plot moved forward at a pretty suitable pace. I am sad to see the world in a downward spiral to Tarmon Gai'don, but all good things must come to an end. I'm most happy with the advancements in character given to Mat, Tuon, Nynaeve, and Egwene. Mat's always been my favorite character, but Knife of Dreams really gave him yet another layer that was done really tastefully.  There is a Tuon POV, which helps build her, and she's fast gaining respect in my eyes.  There are a couple scenes with Nynaeve dealing with Lan that just made me tear up, but I really love those two! <br /> <br /> <br />
N Jacqueline Park's \\"The Secret Book of Grazzia dei Rossi\\" offers a unique and rare look into the life of a Jewish woman at the height of the Italian Renaissance. <br /> <br />Grazzia is an independent, erudite woman whose secret love and quest for knowledge brings her to the attention of the noblewoman, Isabella d'Este. She betrays her faith and embraces it anew, and as she struggles to find her place in a rapidly shifting world of religious intolerance and artistic splendor, we are swept into the musings of her secret diary, which she has dedicated to her son. <br /> <br />This is not your average historical novel: Jacqueline Park depicts a time that defies easy explanations and a heroine often compelled to survival because of her faith. The intrigues and betrayals of the Renaissance, the priviliges of the nobility and the hardships of Jews, are brought to vivid life by a master storyteller whose passion for her subject comes through on every page. <br /> <br />
N The outline looked promising, but the actual content leaves a lot to be desired.  It is riddled with typo's, poor grammer, and bad orginization.  Although it does contain some useful facts; many sentenses are nonsensical and some are just flat out wrong.  All in all, IMHO, it's a bad investment at any price.
N Anything written by Kathleen E. Woodiwiss is a guilty pleasure for me. She writes bodice rippers with some rather cheesy storylines and language full of purple prose. In other words, her books are every romance novel clich&eacute; come to life. However, I still find them enjoyable to read. Guilty pleasures, as stated above. And I have enjoyed all of the novels I have read by her so far with the exception of The Flame and the Flower. The Wolf and the Dove is the most riveting Woodiwiss yet for me, right up there with A Rose in Winter. I am a sucker for Medieval romances and Woodiwiss does a fine job describing this time frame. This novel takes place during the rein of William the Conqueror King, in the year 1066. Wulfgar is a Norman warrior in charge of battling against the Saxons and claiming their lands and properties. Before he is able to arrive to Darkenwald, Ragnor, one of his underlings, gets there first, wreaking unnecessary havoc and killing a noble veteran Saxon warrior, leaving his wife Maida and his daughter Aislinn under the sadist's mercy. Ragnor takes advantage of Aislinn and destroys the lives of everyone in Darkenwald. Things take a disarming turn when Wulfgar arrives in Darkenwald, claiming the land as his own, and turning the Saxons into his slaves. He also decides to turn the beautiful, copper-haired Aislinn into his lover and personal slave. But he soon discovers that Aislinn is feistier and more spirited than most women and bending her to his will won't be easy. But as she is forced to bed the gorgeous, mysterious, women-hating warrior, she cannot help the passion he awakens in her and becomes determined to win his heart at all cost. There are many twists throughout this novel.<br /><br />I have to say that, unlike the other Woodiwiss novels I've read, the main characters in this novel have more depth and are more richly characterized. Wulfgar is an enigma -- a troubled and barbaric warrior with a dark personality that hides kindness, fairness and loneliness within. His hatred for women is understandable once you learn about his past. Aislinn is a fighter, a woman with a passionate, unyielding spirit, not your typical damsel in distress (though she is, in fact, a damsel in distress). This historical romance novel is rather dark. The times of William the Conqueror were barbaric times, and I'm sure that the horrible stuff Wulfgar, Ragnor and the other knights do in this novel pale in comparison to the real stuff that went on in those times. So using this time period as the backdrop for the story was rather risque. I have noticed that Woodiwiss likes to create flawed characters and situations. For the most part, I enjoyed the story and how realistic the protagonists' growth from lust to love is, but this novel is an infuriating roller coaster ride of emotions. I almost closed the book and put it in the trash when I read Wulfgar's appalling answer to Aislinn's news regarding her pregnancy. The man is infuriating and I found myself hating him for a large portion of the book. To me, he was the Shanna of this novel (read my review of Shanna and you'll see what I mean). His treatment of Aislinn is disgusting at times. The fact that I knew he was denying his growing feelings for Aislinn and her determination to obtain him kept me hopeful. But the main problem with this novel is how repetitious it is. For about two-hundred pages, we get this: 1) Wulfgar joins Aislinn in bed and pretty much forces her to have sex with him. 2) Gwyneth, Wulfgar's sister, pouts, yells and calls Aislinn every derogatory name in the world. 3) Wulfgar and Aislinn have arguments in which he mocks her or behaves like a total jerk and she gets angry and insults him. 4) Ragnor swears revenge against Wulfgar. 5) Ragnor hits on Aislinn and tries to rape her, and someone rescues her in the nick of time. Lather, rinse and repeat.<br /><br />I hate to skip pages when I read a book, but I had to, for it was the only way I could avoid so much redundancy. After I skipped almost one-hundred pages, I discovered that I hadn't missed a thing. The novel is too long-winded, unnecessarily so. Also, I agree with the reviewers who say that Aislinn adjusted to the untenable living situation with unrealistic easiness. The way she adjusts to her ordeal is not unlike someone with Stockholm Syndrome. Ech! And there are, of course, the signature Woodiwiss word repetitions. The woman seems to be obsessed with mentioning the characters' eyebrows. The word \\"eyebrow\\" is in almost every paragraph. And was it just me, or did Aislinn spend the entire novel blushing with embarrassment? Other than that, this is the best Woodiwiss offering I have read so far. It supplied the entertainment that I craved. I recommend The Wolf and the Dove for the brain candy entertainment that it is.cy.

N This is a very detailed and exciting read, dealing with an <br />important worldwide subject. Pick up a copy, you will read <br />it fast, and want to encourage friends to read as well.
N I'm glad she admits that this family history is part imagination, as befits a 'historian,' as her preface is three years past the publication date (Jan. 15, 2008).  This very obvious discreptancy makes the reader wonder if the other dates are factual or have been changed to protect some- one or -thing.  Implying that there could be a modern Dracula based on the legend of Vlad the Impaler, some one of her ancestors, this is total fantasy. <br /> <br />The map of \\"Cold War Europe\\" is revealing with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (which no longer exists), United Kingdom (never united but warring), Corsica, west of Italy, Sicily, east of the boot's toe, Poland (Hello, Victor Ashe), France, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Netherlands, Albania, Croatia, Greece, Turkey, Romania, Czechoslavakia, Hungary, Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Crete, and Sardinia (now called the United States of Europe).   <br /> <br />A few years ago, Nick Clooney had a book released about the movies that changed us.  I asked him on the phone early one morning that December which movie changed him; and he replied, \\"Dracula.\\"  This has to be the book for him.  Is it possible for the Dracula of myth to have truly existed?   <br /> <br />First, Professor Rossi, then his heir to the family history, search for clues in such faraway places as Budapest, Istanbul and Eastern Europe (the East bloc).  Were there any such evil ancestor of mine, besides the Black Prince of England, I wouldn't want to know.  I certainly would not put myself in danger by delving into the 'dirty linen' in everybody's family history.  The rogues are the most interesting; the first cousin I thought was so handsome was a murderer  -- went to prison twice for killing two men over 'a woman.'  My dad was afraid of that good-looking (but evil on the inside) nephew, and he had reason to live in fear.  Before he died, it was my pleasure and privilege to tell him that Ed had already died.  He didn't believe me.  Sometimes, fear can take over your entire life. <br /> <br />Father & daughter shared hot tea (with lemon) and sardines at a teahouse as he warns her about his quest concerning the truth of their ancestry.  He told her stories; he wrote letters; he kept files full of his research, and a book, DRAKULA, about the feudal lord, Vlad Tepes, a cruel personage people called Bella Lugoisi, Dracula.  She writes as if this were autobiography and it had taken place in Romania.   <br /> <br />After her father's death, she went on her own search for their past.  This tale \\"blends fact and fantasy, history and the present.\\"  Elizabeth Kostova was educated in the USA at Yale and the University of Michigan, but writes this book in Oxford, England.   \\"The more distant history within this story I have researched as carefully as I would any academic test.  There is a final resource to w hich I've resorted when necessary -- the imagination.\\"  All modern historians do.
N My first reaction to the sight of yet another groundbreaking, landmark book by process theologian David Ray Griffin was one of frank astonishment. I have never seen such overwhelming intellectual power and creativity in the hands of any one individual--ever.<br /><br />Moreover, the quality of his material is typically so far ahead of its time, time and time again, that we should feel fortunate in the extreme to have yet another incredible document \\"from the future\\" here with now, thanks to the truly relentless efforts of David Ray Griffin.
N Some more usual information for neuropathy sufferers laid out in an easy to understand and follow format. This book in the series does not have so many other personal case histories as the other two publications and was not as useful to me.
N This is an absulutely wonderful Dick and Jane book with beautiful illustrations by <br /> Larry Ruppert. He has iullustrated several of the new Dick and Jane series as well as the Bobbsey Twins series and  continues to capture the  retro style with sweet charm and authenticity. This book is great for young kids who will delight in drawing with chalk on the chalkboard pages. My nieces can't put it down. For those of us babyboomers, it's also a book to enjoy and reminisce about our memories of Dick and Jane
N I've read all of Jennifer Weiner's books. This one wasn't the best, but it wasn't horrible either. I enjoyed the mystery aspect, but toward the end the story began to lose steam. The Kate-Evan storyline was the most compelling and I wanted her to dump her lame husband for him. Her relationship with Evan wasn't resolved and the book never really explained how their relationship ended years ago.  <br /> <br />I do love Jennifer Weiner's writing but this one felt a little unfinished, like it needed more tweaking. I agree with other reviewers that there were too many characters to keep track of. Despite all that, I don't regret buying the book and i look forward to her other novels.  <br /> <br />
Y I highly recommend you get this book. Just make sure that you purchase ISBN: 0800757394, the one with the black cover and yellow writing. The other edition is a modern \\"update\\" that has the power of Bosworth's teaching stripped from it.
N It is obvious that the Tax Advisory Panel has relented to the pressures of the lobby community. Just reading their comments as to why they are not considering a National Sales Tax plan...\\"its too regressive\\" or \\" it will require a tax rate b/t 67% & 84% in order to properly fund the government\\". These are both complete fabrications. <br /> <br />This panel was a complete waste of time and did not accomplish ANY of the goals that Bush set forth as the objective for the panel. You can see for yourself at [...] Compare Bush's objectives for the panel to the panel's recommendations and it is clear that the panel was a complete waste of time. <br /> <br />The Fair Tax book lays out an agressive, CONSTITUTIONAL plan to rescue Americans from the \\"iron weight\\" that was twice voted unconstitutional prior to being passed. <br /> <br />Americans need to stand up and fight for HR 25
N When studying for the COMLEX, osteopathic medical students have always been short on finding alternatives. COMLEX Review finally fills the void for high-yield, easy to read and understand review books for the osteopathic manipulative medicine portions of the osteopathic boards.
Y I could relate to Frances because I have spent many years obese. I realize many people didn't like this book. I wonder if I like it so much because I've recently lost 70 pounds.<br /><br />I am now a different person on the outside...but inside, it's still me. People treat me differently though, just like they did Frances. It does mess with your mind. Let's face it, in our society, fat=lazy and/or bad. Our world is filled with hate towards fat people.<br /><br />Frances underwent huge changes--physically, emotionally. Her story helped me and it opened my eyes. I appreciated her honesty, which at times was immature, but to be expected. She was going through life changes one normally has happen to them in their teens and twenties. I appreciated her courage and I enjoyed this book.
N Since the 1992 presidential run of H. Ross Perot, there has been a growing awareness in American politics and society of the financial burden Social Security amd Medicare will have on future generations.  This book is one of several to examine this issue and to propose solutions for it.   <br /> <br />In short, this book explains how the demographic changes occurring within the US will make Social Security and Medicare very expensive for future generations to pay for.  Specifically, as the ratio of workers to retirees gets smaller and smaller, each worker will have to contribute more and more of his/her income to provide for the benefits of the retiree.  This book clearly illustrates this problem, and with some simple math, explains how this problem grows bigger with time.  The book also looks at some of the possible and proposed solutions to this problem.  These include raising the eligibility age for benefits, raising social security taxes, eliminating benefits for people above a certain income level, etc...   The book examines the pros and cons of each of these suggestions, and their efficacy and political viability.   <br /> <br />The book also forecasts what might happen to the US economy if Social Security is not reformed and how the govt might finance itself.  Overall, a good book to read.
N I am 14 years old, and frankly, after reading this book, I started to question the way i live my life. Many people look at this book and see \\"MTV\\" and instantly say it is trash. This is my favorite book. Why? you ask, because it is the one I read last.
N I got to proofread \\"From Dust and Ashes,\\" one of Tricia's other novels, & wasn't disappointed. So I also asked to proofread \\"Dawn of a Thousand Nights: A Story of Honor.\\" Again, I was definitely NOT disappointed! I literally had to MAKE myself slow down so I could proofread carefully! I was hooked from the first page. It's definitely a 5-star book--a fascinating read, sad because of Pearl Harbor & other elements but also hopeful. It also takes place in WWII. We are there at Pearl Harbor; we are there with the women fliers (WAFS/WASPS) who transported planes across the country to free up male pilots for the war (one of the aspects of WWII I didn't know about until this book). We are also there in the Philippines, including the Bataan Death March & the horrid Japanese POW camps. Yet even through some of the worst circumstances of the war, this gifted author shows us that God truly cares & loves each of His children, & He can & will bring victory out of defeat. Such a powerful message of hope, love, & grace!       Historical figures are included, but the fiction & history mesh well. Readers even get to \\"see\\" from a Japanese point of view. The characters are compelling; I couldn't wait to know what happened to them! There is a touch of romance, but it's not overdone. This book is much more about the history, the people who lived it, and what they experienced during WWII. It's packed with emotions from those historical events: realism, fear, hope, faith, & love in the midst of extremely difficult times...& the gamut of emotions those who lived through WWII experienced. This is truly a unique and compelling book with characters who have depth & conflicts; I felt like I was there in each of the three main character's minds. Each of the chapters starts with actual historical newspaper excerpts, which adds a unique realism not always found in novels.      I have proofed well over 600 books, & I write reviews on VERY few. But Tricia Goyer's books are, quite simply, excellent!I have not found another author like her, and I am immensely thankful that I got to work on this book. I had to have \\"Night Song,\\" and since I didn't get to proof that, I bought it. Even though \\"Dawn\\" may seem like a long book, it's well worth your time! I love historical books that I can \\"sink my teeth into\\"--ones that have depth and a great story mixed with history--not short, shallow books that only use history as a backdrop or setting.     This book was my jumping-off place to learn more about the war in the Pacific & the Bataan Death March. If you love WWII historical novels, you won't be able to put this book down! It has stayed with me since May 2004! Don't miss this! I'm so glad I didn't. :-)     I've already asked the publisher if I can proofread Tricia Goyer's next book. I can hardly wait! :-) I cannot recommend   this book highly enough! Enjoy!
N The Baby-Sitters Club books were the first that I remember reading. When I was a child, I would take books to the dinner table and read during a meal (not the best manners, but my parents were ok with it because they encouraged me to read whenever I could). I was crazy about the BSC--I had the videos, dolls, even the sleeping bag (which I received for my 11th birthday). I can say that I've read up to the point where the acquired Abby as a new sitter, but I spotted \\"Graduation Day\\" and had to read it. I feel that I \\"grew up\\" with these girls--even though they are still 13 and I am now 23. The ending of a favorite series is bittersweet. Months ago, \\"passed the torch\\" to my 8 year old niece. On the first day of summer, I mailed her a copy of Kristy's Great Idea. She has fallen in love with the BSC and has now taken over the collection. When I went back home a few weeks ago, I had to smile when I saw a copy of \\"Claudia's Goodbye\\" in my old chair at the table.  <br />\\"Graduation Day\\" was terrific. The perfect ending to a wonderful coming-of age series. Goodbye, Girls.
N This book is a great read for market researchers and the general population alike.  Dr. McEwen has put together a truly compelling \\"tale\\" of how certain brands entice followings, and how or why said followings are either maintained and groomed, or discarded.  A fascinating cultural study, as well as a meticulous scientific one, this is a great present for anyone who's ever wondered how Disney or Coca Cola has come to the prominence they enjoy today.  To have put together so much information in such a fun, readable way is Dr. McEwen's true gift, and he should be lauded for it.  Bravo!
Y I must worn potential readers that the vampires in this novella are killers, even the hero (if anyone can call him that).  They kill their prey when they feed, so for me they have no redeeming graces no matter how polite, handsome, sexy, etc that they are.  I really did not want to read more than the first few pages, but since I spent so much money on this very short novella, I thought I could probably stand to finish it.  I found the writing less than spectacular also.  The descriptions and scenes seemed to be written in an amateur fashion, so I could not think of the characters as \\"real.\\"  The two main characters fell in love so quickly that I had to read the page again to be sure I had gotten it correct.  Nia was ready for Seth to make a move on her before he even came in the door.  Others may like this sort of approach, but I need some buildup for the relationship to ring true.  While I did like the mixed race content, the rest of it left me cold.  Killer vampires are just not my cup of tea and I could care less if they meet their mates and live happily ever after.  Just think of how many people over the centuries had their lives cut short so that these vampires could continue their existence. Even Nia's friend Imani is killed in the first three pages of the story.  What more can I say.
N I am not one who cares for \\"romance\\" but when someone suggested that books by Kate Cameron were in the genre of \\"historical romance\\" I still didn't think there would be much of a difference.  I hung on to the book for several years and then, one hurricane week, without electricity and no work, I lit a candle and sat down to read ORENDA.  It has become one of my favorite books. Steeped in history, with a tale so compelling that I almost couldn't bear to finish it, I rushed out and bought all the other Kate Cameron (a.k.a. Beverly McGlamry) books I could find.  She is a writer of inestimable talent.  Her tale, while fictional, is woven within the tight constraints of factual history, so there are moments of gruesome reality. But this is juxtapositioned against a story of beauty, family, land and loss.  You needn't be particularly interested in the saga of the Iroquois Nation (on which this book is based) but I promise that you will be drawn in as easily as I was, to a world I never knew about.  This is a story beautifully told, of great moments and tragic ones, all exquisitely written with the true hand of a master historian.
N The United States has made some fundamental changes in its foreign policy as a result of the 9/11 attacks. These largely center around the almost unilateral decisions to change the governments of Afghanistan and Iraq. The United States had the power to do this, and exercised that power.  <br /> <br />It appeared unlikely that the US would get UN approval or a UN based coalition to work together. France and Russia were getting favorable oil pricing from Iraq in exchange for weapons and would likely veto any decision in the Security Council. The addition of numerous Islamic states into the General Assembly. So the decision was made to proceed anyway. It was certainly popular with the American people still operating in great anger after 9/11.  <br /> <br />Americans tend to believe with an almost religious fervor that our way is best, that the America system (under God) is clearly the way that the world should work. Americans believe that their global actions are benevolent, that the rest of the world is almost child like, and should look up to us as a father.  <br /> <br />The rest of the world doesn't exactly agree. The Islamic countries look at the US support of Israel and see a contempt for Islam. Europe looks at the US with some alarm. President Bush is often viewed as some kind of pistol packing Texas cowboy.  <br /> <br />Any book like this is a snapshot of the situation at a given time as seen by one person, the author. He certainly presents an interesting fview of other states worred about US dominance and who are starting to turn their concerns into action.  <br /> <br />It's an interesting book to read now, and it will be interesting to read in ten years or so to see just how a good a predictor Dr. Walt turns out to be.
N I saw this book at a client's house while there to give their Lab a private lesson.  As a clicker trainer, I am usually wary of training books because so many of them give outdated advice. What a wonderful surprise this book turned out to be! It is filled with dead-on, fabulous advice & is written in a clear, easy to read style. It is enhanced by plenty of photos and illustrations, as well. I was particularly impressed by the inclusion of items such as Calming Signals!  I highly recommend this book for  owners of any breed dog who want to learn to train & communicate with their dog in the most effective and humane way. I plan to buy this book to offer for sale in my dog obedience school.
N I was a little disappointed with this book.  Jennifer Weiner is one of my favorite authors but it was hard for me to get past the liberal bias and conservative critisim in this book.  Had she left the politics out of the book I would have given it 4 or possibly even 5 stars.  I hope in the future she does not incorporate politics into her books....I enjoy reading them but that was a big turn off for me.
N I have been listening to many of these Sounds True and similar audiocassettes recently, looking for good meditation material.  Fortunately, since the exploration is pretty hit-or-miss for me, the Seattle library has a lot of them (including this one), so I am able to preview them.  For my taste, The Second Half of Life is better in its intention than its execution.  Overall, for my money, a more successful work (also available both at Amazon and the Seattle library) is A Woman's Spiritual Retreat: Teaching, Meditations, and Rituals to Celebrate Your Authentic Feminine Wisdom, by Joan Borysenko.  Although it focuses primarily on women's wisdom and growth, as opposed to second-half-of-life wisdom and growth, it hits a lot of the same notes and also draws on myth and ritual.  (Another, much shorter work in a similar vein that I also found more successful is the meditation CD, Celtic Spirit Meditations, by Mara Freeman--also available at Amazon and reviewed by me here.)     Certainly, the intention of The Second Half of Life is to help people do some positive growth in their later years, drawing on wisdom of many cultures, and as the positive reviews attest, it does accomplish this very well for some people.  However, for me, Ms. Arrien picks some good myths, tales and themes for her foundation, but then doesn't do enough substantive and rigorous work with them.  The basic pattern (except for the Preferential Shapes exercise, see below) is to tell a tale or introduce a character or concept, give her interpretation (which often seems either too simplistic and schematic or too arbitrary, as other reviewers have noted), and then to say, \\"So where am I with __________ in my life?\\" [Fill in the blank with the theme or symbol just discussed.] The psychologizing offered, although constructive, seems--well, mostly self-evident.  To someone who grew up loving much of the original source material in its pure, story form, some of the interpretations actually diminish the stories'inherent symbolic meaning.      I did find both the description and the interpretation of the Nine Muses pretty good, and was pleased to come across a theme I'd been looking for but hadn't found elsewhere (except in Layne Redmond's wonderful music CD Invoking the Muse, also available on Amazon).  The Pandora's Box story has an interesting comparison of this myth in different cultures (including what was left in the bottom of the box, according to the different cultures).  The Preferential Shapes section gives you something specific to do, an exercise with your preferences for five universal shapes. I found this exercise to provide some helpful insights, albeit in a fortune-telling kind of way.  The 12 Labors of Hercules got a retelling that was somehow both cursory and redundant, and the interpretations here felt especially arbitrary and forced to me.  Like another reviewer, I found the Eight Gates rather suspect in how Ms. Arrien drew together elements supposedly from many sources to arrive at this particular interpretation (and I also could have done without the gnomes!), although there is some good material about initiation and transition here.  Overall, there seems to be a lot of focus on schematic, numbered, arbitrary hierarchies.     I also found the material overall to be too repetitive and slow-moving, and like another reviewer with the same problem, was irked by the verbal delivery (the uneven rhythm, the tone, and a tendency to do repetitions of phrases that did not feel naturally emphatic and became quite irritating).  It would be nice if Amazon would provide not only the Search Inside This Book function for books on tape (sadly missing here), so that people can get an idea of the specific content and tone, but also audioclips for books on tape, as they do for music CDs.  These audiocassettes are often quite pricey, and long, and one's personal reaction to the voice of the narrator is pretty important.  The Sounds True website does have audio samples formany of their authors' items, including this one.
N Again, Laura Jensen Walker manages to make me laugh just when I need it most!  This sequel was well worth the wait, and I'm already looking forward to her next novel.  If you see this book on a shelf somewhere, grab it and run home to your favorite spot and curl up.   You'll definatley be in for a treat!
Y This book gives a great description of what living with Fibro is like. It helped me not feel so alone with my illness and realize that others do have similiar symptoms. If I had read this book earlier it would have saved me from a needless bladder surgery that did more harm than good.
N The Widow of the South stacks up in my book of must reads, along with other great historical fictions by Eugenia Price.  Robert Hicks was able to bring Carrie McGavock back to life & I thoroughly enjoyed reading about her changing world.  Each Chapter of Hick's masterpiece was written from a different character's perspective & this proved to enrich my mind by shedding light on the world that once was from several points of view.  Those that resided at Carnton may have passed on & may be resting in the very ground with which they once walked, but Hicks has helped them live on & I thank him for introducing them to me.
Y Grandmum was a children's librarian and always finds the great books for my daughter.<br /><br />This is a sweet little book that has become my daughters favorite(she is 4).  She found it funny that a cat, a squirrel and a duck would live together, play music, and make soup.<br /><br />Each has a part to their events as each plays a certain instrument, and each has a certain part to the making of the soup.<br /><br />Chaos happens when the duck decides he wants to try something different.<br /><br />It of course has a happy ending.<br /><br />The art is very good as my daughter likes looking at it.<br /><br />A good book for bed time reading!
Y The first two thirds of the book discusses various biases to how people reason.  For example, the human mind is excellent at recognizing patterns in things...to such a degree that we find many patterns in things which are actually random.  Another bias is the basic tendency to be accepting of evidence which is consistent with our belief but subjecting contradictory evidence to more careful scrutiny.  I have heard the explanation that chronic gamblers tend to relive their wins and block out their losses.  In actual fact, they dwell on the losses a lot more than the wins.  If so, why do they continue not only to gamble, but believe that they are better at it than they really are?  The answer is that their wins are almost always viewed as due to talent and many of the losses are re-categorized as \\"near wins.\\" (\\"If not for that field goal in the last seconds of the game, I would have won\\"--much more so than the corresponding \\"I almost lost that one, but they kicked a field goal at the end of the game and saved it for me.\\")  The first 125 pages cover six different types of bias (and variations of them). <br /> <br />The last third of the book analyzes three cases (alternative medicine, social interaction strategies, & ESP) where there is a lot of belief which is not supported by evidence.  These help a lot in making the ideas from the first part more concrete.
N This brightly colored book is great to use as an addition to a Spanish curriculum.<br /><br />The sturdy pages continue to wow my classes of ages 3 all the way to 14 years old. If you'd like to introduce your child to Spanish, I might choose an animal, colors, or shapes book before this one, and you might want to get something they can WRITE on or color rather than just look at.<br /><br />Overall, I think it's great to know ANY word (especially toys, which are everywhere!) when you're trying to introduce a second language to your child. It's a big endeavor, and this book helps!<br /><br />Sra. Gose<br />Author of [[ASIN:0980177219 Flip Flop Spanish: Ages 3-5: Level 1]] & [[ASIN:0980177200 Flip Flop Spanish: Ages 3-5: Level 2]]
N I thought of several different ways in which to begin this review - several witty comparisons that would surely catch the reader's attention. But that was a month and a half ago. See, I started reading Blue Like Jazz on the 20th of July and it is now the 4th of October. I have four pages left and I'm not sure I have the strength to continue.    For you see: Donald Miller is wearying. Endlessly self-amused and self-absorbed, he seems to want nothing so much as to be hip, cool, edgy (despite his own protests that hip, edgy, and cool are vanities and wastes of time and energy). And if four years of highschool taught me anything, it is that everyone with a heart is thoroughly and deeply embarrassed when the Very Not Cool Guy walks in and tries to be cool. Think: The Offspring's \\"Pretty Fly for a White Guy.\\"    The thing is: Christianity cannot be cool. There is no reason non-believers should see Christianity as anything even on the same plane as Cool. Christianity says and believes terrifying things about the non-believer. Forget the homosexuals a minute - Christianity says that the friendly, tax-paying, socially-active, community-leading paragon of virtue who doesn't bow the knee to Christ is horribly wicked and an actual enemy of God. No matter how kind and cool they are. For Christianity to become cool, it has to stop having anything to do with Christ and his message. Maybe Donald Miller wants that. It kinda seems like it, but who can say - since he's not that great at expressing anything beyond his own meandering and fleeting feelings on matters.    About two-thirds into the book, a friend (who won't receive an identity via nickname, such as Tony the Beat Poet or Andrew the Protester) asked me what kind of a book it was. I had a hard time describing it at first. Then I realized: \\"OMG!! I'm reading a blog on paper! LOL!!\\" Really, Miller's book is nothing more than a glorified blog in its meandering promise to get to a point that never comes. In reality, Miller wouldmake a much better blogger than he does a writer. Unfortunately, even as a blogger, he would only be so good - because despite moments of value and bits that come close to insight, his style is heavy-handed and obvious for too much of the book's 240 pages (I know, only 240 pages and it's taken me almost two-and-a-half months!).     One good-but-obvious point Miller makes throughout the book is that the human expression of Christianity in the contemporary American church is lacking at best, gravely flawed at worst, but most likely, somewhere in between. This is clearly true. But also clearly known to probably most of us. And the real problems are not often the ones that Miller is pointing out - he seems frequently upset at how little the church fits in with a world filled with lovely sinners. Yet still, there is value in his critique.    But not much. Again Miller shows himself to be like too many bloggers; and like too many bloggers, he has much criticism and too few answers. If he were a blogger, this might be acceptable; after all, the only cost associated with reading a blog is time (and perhaps mental health). A book, however, is paid in currency. There is real loss if a book does not measure up to its published value - and Blue Like Jazz does not. I hate to say that because there are a few amusing stories and I get the feeling the book wants to be useful - but it just isn't.
N I enjoyed Margaret Creighton's book.  From far off Yarmouth, Maine, she has thrown her nets far and wide and hauled in a lot of historical flotsam and jetsam that might have escaped other scholars, in service of putting together another of her finely tuned historical studies of the underserved in American history.  Here we find out more about the immigrant populations who comprised the Union Army, as well as the actual lives of the women of Gettysburg and the black citizens of the surrounding area.  These are the shadow puppets of history, the folks who you might never have learned about by visiting the national park nor studying your social studies book.<br /><br />You probably heard more about Mamie Eisenhower's residence at Gettysburg than you did about the women who were drafted into battle, whether they were forced to nurse, to cook, to slave, or to fight.  Why is this?  Partially, as Professor Creighton explains, these women were told, and they believed it, that their sacrifices did not matter.  And that, perhaps, there was even something a little bit shameful about what they did, particularly if they were required to assist the invading Confederate army.  Of the ravishment and rape that undoubtedly occurred, we know little but can surmise much, thanks to Creighton's research and the guarded testimony of forty Gettysburg women, mostly farmwives.  Creighton looks at the nuance behind every statement, searching out human reality wherever it crops it head.  \\"A middle-aged woman on a farm opened her door to a soldier on July second.  By the way he was dressed, she was sure that he was a Louisiana Tiger.  He told her that `General Lee had said that they should ask for food and if they would not give it they should demand it and that was what he was going to do.'  She fed him ham.  He ate some of it and then insulted her.  The bread, he complained, was not fit to eat,  `Madam,' he said, `I can go into any cabin in Virginia, poor and desolate as it is, from Winchester to Richmond, with not a fence standing, and get a better dinner than this.'\\"  Creighton returns to this anecdote to eke out perceptions on the nature of resistance, and the implacability of the bad ham (Gettysburg women had to be fine actresses, for otherwise the Tiger in question might have guessed that the farmwife had fine chickens hidden with their beaks taped.)<br /><br />As Creighton acknowledges, the presence of women on the Gettysburg battlefield is currently a contested site for scholars, particular feminist scholars, and she acknowledges that a host of others are trawling the same fields.  The material remains of interest, and does indeed widen our picture of what happened that summer long ago, but I wondered, after finishing the book, if perhaps she might have written three separate books, for there's a sense in which the struggles of the immigrant soldiers, the Gettysburg women, and the freed, escaped or citizen slaves are experiences of very different registers and don't mesh together especially well except under cloudy language of the deracinated and ignored, and although Creighton tries her best, she can only link them this vaguely for the first two hundred times, then after that her rhetoric grows tiresome.ter to Richmond, with not a fence standing, and get a better dinner than this.'\\"  Creighton returns to this anecdote to eke out perceptions on the nature of resistance, and the implacability of the bad ham (Gettysburg women had to be fine actresses, for otherwise the Tiger in question might have guessed that the farmwife had fine chickens hidden with their beaks taped.) <br /> <br />As Creighton acknowledges, the presence of women on the Gettysburg battlefield is currently a contested site for scholars, particular feminist scholars, and she acknowledges that a host of others are trawling the same fields.

N Having read the book, I passed it on to my wife, and we have made significant changes in lifestyle. I then picked-up a copy for my mom. This book is not the final solution to all your needs, but it definitely will make you consider all the junk we put into our bodies. It inspires one to practice healthier principles to living better everyday. Good advice on organic foods and the over use of medications in this country. It only makes sense to practice preventive measures, than wait for the production line of prescription drugs that surely will follow. What are we so afraid of the public learning from this book? VERY ENLIGHTENING IN MANY WAYS. Read for yourself and decide.
N Barbara Lanza has created the elegant, elaborate, enchanted world of Fairy Lane, the home of Petals, a fairy child who has the honor of sprinkling fairy dust on the baby fairies on a particular evening. It's an important responsibility because while baby fairies are born with wings, they cannot fly without the magic fairy dust. Petals (who tends to be a bit messy) is in a bit of a panic -- she can't find the all-important pouch of fairy dust! Young readers will be focused on the pages of this superbly, wonderfully illustrated picturebook story as they follow Petals in her efforts to search all around Fairy Lane for the missing pouch. Time To Fly is an impressive, original, and enthusiastically recommended picturebook addition for family, elementary school, and community library collections -- and leave young readers eagerly looking forward to future adventures of Petals and her friends on Fairy Lane!
N DO NOT BE FOOLED AS I WAS! I ordered this study guide in preparation for the ASE tests that I was going to be taking this fall.  This guide is very poorly put together and NOT EVEN PROOFREAD apparently...it's a complete joke!  Let me give you a few examples of why this is a HUGE waste of your money. <br /> <br />First of all, as you may or may not already know the ASE test questions are copyrighted and therefore CANNOT be reproduced.  This means that the \\"sample questions\\" in this guide are not ACTUAL ASE questions, but rather questions that the author of the book made up that are designed to be similar in style to the ones you would see on a real ASE exam.  ALL study guides are this way, which is fine so long as the person making up the questions is somewhat competent...the person who wrote this book IS NOT COMPETENT.  Many of the questions are quite misleading, and some of the answers are just plain wrong! EVEN according to the information that THEY THEMSELVES give in the study guide! <br /> <br />There are so many typo's and mistakes in this book I got the feeling I was reading a book report written by my 3rd grade sister.   <br /> <br />Each sample question is SUPPOSEDLY linked (by way of a reference number with a corresponding section) back to the section that explains how to do the procedure from which the question was based.  THERE WERE SEVERAL SAMPLE QUESTIONS THAT LINKED BACK TO A SECTION IN THE BOOK THAT DIDN'T EVEN EXIST!!!!! I mean, how frustrating is that! <br /> <br />And then there is this hoopla that they sell you on about having \\"explanations for each sample question telling why the correct answer is right as well as why the wrong answers are wrong.\\"  WHAT A QUACK!  A typical example of one of the sample questions and their \\"detailed explanation\\" for it would go something like this: <br /> <br />Question: <br />Technician A says [blah, blah, blah]. Technician B says [yada yada yada]. Who is correct? <br /> <br />a. Technician A <br />b. Technician B<br />c. Both Technicians A and B are correct <br />d. Neither Technician A or B is correct <br /> <br />Explanation: <br />a. The correct answer is a. \\"technician A is correct\\" <br />b. Answer B is not correct: [restates what technician B said WORD FOR WORD here] is not correct. [WHAT THE CRAP KIND OF EXPLANATION IS THAT???????!!!!!!] <br />c. Answer C is not correct because technician B is incorrect. <br />d. Answer D is not correct because technician A is correct. <br /> <br />WOULD THIS NOT FRUSTRATE YOU TOO WITH YOUR TESTS FAST APPROACHING? <br /> <br />Anyway, the first ASE study guide that I bought was a MITCHELL1 series study guide....after becoming very frustrated at the quality of the study guide I decided to purchase a different brand, so I went with the DELMAR series study guide and MUCH TO MY DISMAY when it arrived I found that it was THE EXACT SAME BOOK as the MITCHELL1!!!!  BUYERS BEWARE!!! Apparently DELMAR learning bought out MITCHELL, as well as CHILTON repair books companies and now has some sort of monopoly on the whole market.  It's sickening really...not because of the monopoly so much, but because DELMAR puts out such horrible products.   <br /> <br />Anyway, I just thought I would give you all the heads up so you do not make the same mistake I did....when I bought the book there were no reviews on it so after my experience I thought SOMEBODY needs to expose this JUNK for what it is.  I would put the company out of business if I could.  DO everyone a favor...spread the word around that DELMAR does NOT sell good products!  <br /> <br />
N Kim's work has won the praise of many, not least Robert Aitken Roshi, an American with a lifetime's experience of Zen training. In his foreword to the third edition, Aitken Roshi stated:   <br /> <br /> \\"this revised edition . . .now includes many new translations and studies of Dogen, and thus it is most welcome. Dogen wrote at the outermost edge of human communication, touching with every sentence such mysteries as self and other, self and non-self, meditation and realization, the temporal and the timeless, forms and the void.@He wrote of the attitude necessary for understanding, of the practice required. . .of the various insights that emerge, and of the many pitfalls. He did not generally write for beginners - most of his points require very careful study and a few of them elude almost everybody. These challenges are compounded by his creative use of the Japanese language. It has been said that he wrote in \\"Dogenese,\\" for he made verbs of nouns, nouns of verbs, created new metaphors, and manipulated old sayings to present his particular understanding. . . \\"  <br /> <br /> Prof. Kim's study has been based on a careful reading of Dogen's chosen idioms. He has endeavoured to amplify Dogen's understanding of 'do-ri' - or 'reason of the way.' Kim is keen to show that Dogen's use of Zen language is not merely provisional or instrumental, but embodies a 'realisational' dimension. This is exemplified in the notion of the 'genjo-koan' or koan realised in the present, which is to say, actualised in every day activity. In this way, Kim endeavours to show that Dogen's Zen culminates in ' the great way of total exertion' (gujin no daido) or the total actualisation of practice as realization. Kim is a foremost interpreter of Dogen's thought - and, as such, this book deserves a place in every Buddhist library. My only reservation about this study, is that it might have made better sense of the question of how the so-called 'instrumentalist' aspect of koan practice relates tothe 'realizational' aspect. Quite rightly, Kim is at pains to point out that accounts of Zen which stress the 'instrumentalist' view of koan practice - and that alone, are one sided, and he has therefore endeavoured to illustrate a different perspective. However, without reflection, we might be left to conclude that Rinzai Zen favours the 'instrumentalist' view - and Soto, the 'realizational' view. Kim knows better, and indeed, in places (p. 165), he has cited certain remarks from Dogen, which concede that the term 'genjo-koan' originated with Engo - a Rinzai master of the Sung, evidently meaning that Rinzai practitioners have appreciated the 'realizational' aspect. As such, the critical references to (Dai-e) Ta-hui which appear elsewhere in the book, seem strangely out of tenor with this fact. Yuan-wu (Engo) was Ta-hui's teacher, and the latter must surely have known of his master's references to the genjo-koan. Conversely, much as we might identify Dogen's Zen with 'shikantaza' (just-sitting), playing down the instrumentalist approach, Dogen also had his experience of 'casting off mind and body' (shinjindatsuraku) - a breakthrough experience more or less akin to that realised by Rinzai followers. Perhaps Prof. Kim will enlighten us on this unresolved problem, at some future point.

N If you are looking for something to stimulate your brain, this isn't it.  However, if you are just looking for a good laugh, you'll enjoy The Bad Girl's Guide.  It's funny and light, and definitely a good way to pass a little bit of time	.
N Though she is honored to be Chicago Woman of the Year, Victoria Colby-Camp is more euphoric over the mental improvement that her son Jim has shown recently especially since he and Tasha North fell in love.  Jim was snatched almost twenty years ago when he was seven and turned into the killing Seth whose goal was to murder Victoria for abandoning him.  However, her elation would turn to despair if she knew Seth resurfaced and started to rape a pregnant Tasha.<br /><br />Former military strategist Daniel Marks is in town complements of the Colby Agency that wants to hire him.  Also in Chicago is Emily Hastings whose father a veteran homicide detective was murdered.  She finds letters linking her dad to Victoria, the woman's long ago murdered first husband James, and her dad's first partner Marelyn Rutland that confuses her.  Soon she will meet Daniel and they will be embroiled in the COLBY CONSPIRACY that goes back almost two decades ago.<br /><br />Though the subplots can become confusing at first, once the audience comprehends how this complex superb suspense thriller starts to come together, they will want more Colby Agency tales; (see FILES FROM THE COLBY AGENCY: THE BODYGUARD'S BABY PROTECTIVE CUSTODY).  The ensemble cast is solid as fans will feel with Victoria who has overcome so much tragedy, hope Jim \\"defeats\\" Seth with Tasha at his side, and root for Daniel and Emily to make it while wondering what really happened two decades ago.  A final twist marks a strong Webb of deceit tale that showcases a fine author on her A-game.<br /><br />Harriet Klausne	r
N Review based on a cursory examination by University of Phoenix students in Philosophy 251.  <br />We have found the book to be well organized, and detailed. The structure placed the information in an easy to read and presentable manner. <br />The use of strong and sound proofs by experiment and examples supported the overall logic of reasoning in a clear and concise manner. <br />We have found the book to be well thought out and laid out so the reader can learn and follow what is being explained. <br /	>
N My only complaint is that this book was a bit repetative, and Holden's vocabulary only consists of 4 words: sonuvabitch, goddamn, lousy and phony. It was still quite humorous and the actual story was interesting.<br /><br />It was easy to read and to relate to, so you should pick it up if you're looking for a fun read. Some people complain about the lack of a plot, but to understand this book you need to read deeper into it. It's actually a lot more than some annoying kid's list of complaints about life.<br /><br />The story is about Holden Caulfield's coming of age and realizing that growing up is not a process that can be stopped. He had a lousy childhood, as he puts it, and wants to save other children from going though the things he experienced in his life. He is telling the story from a mental institution, which he was placed in after returning home from the fourth Prep school he had been kicked out of. He flashes back to the events leading up to his arrival at his home and tells the story of those 3 days	.
N When looking for &lt;a href=\\"[...]\\">lock picking books&lt;/a>, this one is very informative. It will give one great ideas on opening padlocks, but the language is very basic, no frills here. This is not a romance novel, it's how to open locks without keys, and that's it. You will learn what you need to here. But you should always seek out more knowledge	.
Y Never been much for enjoying history, but the style, brevity, and choice of subject matter come together very nicely in this book	.
N I thoroughly enjoyed reading Faith is a verb by Chris Goodrich. The book covers facts regarding the history of the organization Habitat for Humanity and the author's experiences volunteering. Goodrich writes about the places, the people, and the volunteers he has encountered during his five-year experience with Habitat for Humanity. The author speaks straight from the heart, some of which brought tears to my eyes, some of sadness, some of laughter. Even through all the heart-wrenching sights, Goodrich and his crew persevere, regardless of the obstacles they face. Goodrich's experiences include traveling around the world, from America to London from London to Paraguay even getting lost in the Sierra, Faith is a Verb, is a fantastic read. In addition, the book opens a person's eyes and heart to the devastation and suffering that many see everyday of their lives. The book puts into perspective just how lucky we are even though we may not think so; it made me not only look at my ethics and values but also encouraged me to pick up that hammer	.
Y If you are stumped for the perfect gift to bring to your dinner host, to give to your dinner guests, or for any other small gift occasion, Furry Logic is the answer.  Everyone loves this book	.
Y At last... a comprehensive visual compendium of the most celebrated artistic promotional film marketing campaign worldwide... almost.  You would think that the opulent Mr. Sansweet would have in his possession every single poster to have ever rolled off the printing press for this unprecedented franchise but several of my favorite foreign one-sheets, daybills, banners and bus stop posters are notably missing.  Does this mean that Mr. Sansweet has not aquired all of them in his envious collection of Star Wars memorabilia?  Not likely.  Chances are he has every single one of them... locked away somewhere within the bowels of his coveted archives.  Most notably absent is the lack of reference material specifically promoting Revenge of the Sith and would seem to indicate that this book was completed and ready to be published just prior to the film's theatrical exhibition, but there is a plethora of wonderful international promotional material such as the six character U.K. bus stop posters that are much more visually exciting than the disappointing U.S. domestic ad campaign that demands to be published.  This can only mean that another volume must be sure to follow.  Still, there are enough international poster variations out there to keep collectors like myself and presumably Mr. Sansweet himself scouring the farthest reaches of the globe and the galaxy for years to come	.
N To his discredit, Dr. Unwin virtually brags in the introductory chapter that nearly all of the questions and arguments that have mystified pterosaurs since their discovery have been answered in recent years,  but when it comes time to reveal those answers, Unwin typically sidesteps. Origins? Still not sure. Family tree? With over a hundred genera to choose from,  and many recently discovered, Unwin falls back on a favorite few and places them on an antique tree, not a modern cladogram. While Unwin's writing style is refreshing and easy to read (every chapter opens with short fiction), and his photos are first rate, the line work is rarely original and never detailed. Almost nothing is shown from the neck down. Only skulls are presented. Most, if not all, of the drawings  are recognizable from other sources. So, a disappointed reader here	.

N During the reign of Henry VIII, at fourteen Elizabeth Meredith inherited Friarsgate when her mother and older middle sister married and moved onto their respective spouses' estate and her oldest sibling and her husband chose the king's court.  Eight years later she remains independent running her estate until her mother informs her she must marry so that an heir can inherit Friarsgate.<br /><br />Her beloved sixty years old Uncle Thomas agrees to escort the feisty landowner to court.  However, before they leave for London, Baen MacColl comes from Scotland at the behest of his father to discus a sheep deal.  As the two die in the wool anti-marital soul mates fall in love, Elizabeth chaperoned by her uncle travels to the king's court.  There she befriends the beleaguered queen while Henry VIII begins his campaign to replace his wife Katherine with Anne.<br /><br />The key to this battle between two independent obstinate loving combatants is the background that incorporates Henry's antics as he sets in motion his plan to remove Katherine of Aragon as queen and replace her with Anne Boleyn.  Bertrice Small cleverly uses the monumental sixteenth century events to tell her story of love yet in some ways the shadow overwhelms the lead characters.  Fans of historical romance with strong doses of both will enjoy the latest Meredith tale (see UNTIL YOU AND PHILIPPA).<br /><br />Harriet Klausne	r

N The Outlander series are my favorite books of all time, period.  But after reading the Fiery Cross, I was a bit let down, as many people were, and afraid that the rest of the series would just continue to go downhill.  So when A Breath of Snow and Ashes came out, I was so glad to see that it was getting good reviews.  I finally got to read it this week and was not disappointed in the least. <br />All the characters we know and love are back, and Brianna seems to have finally grow up.  She has been my least favorite character since the second book, but this time around she was actually likeable (for the most part).  At certain points this book became so intense that I actually had to put it down and take a break for awhile, but not all readers will have this experience, only ones that are practically obsessed with this series (and who's friends have to remind them, \\"Jamie is NOT a real person!).    <br />So basically, if you have read the previous books, just read this one. Please.  You won't regret it.  The only reason I didn't give this one five stars is that I think nothing can top Outlander and Dragonfly in Amber.  If I could give this 4.5, I would. <br /> <br />One thing I have wondered about - if Claire dies back in the 1700's, then she'll be born again in 1918, go back in time in 1946, die in the 1700's, be born in 1918, and just keep repeating this forever.  For all she knows this could be her tenth time doing this.  I haven't seen this matter dealt with in the books.  Did I just miss it or something	?
Y This is a marvelous read, and those already familiar with the Abel Jones series will not be disappointed.  Again, I am amazed and appreciative of the amount of research that Mr. Parry puts into his novels, and this book is a prime example.  It is a wonderful story that not only entertains, but also enlightens about one of the most important eras in our history, and, one of the most important cities and cultures (New Orleans) in our country.  I couldn't put it down and read it all in one sitting.  Thank again to the author, and I look forward to reading about how the venerable Abel Jones will come to grips with his latest personal struggle regarding family over duty	!
N The premise of the book is hilarious: Dick and Jane, all grown up and still living in suburbia. But this isn't the suburbia of Ward and June Cleaver. It's the suburbia of \\"Desperate Housewives\\" with a Yiddish twist.<br /><br />It made me nostalgic for my years living in Miami Beach. Oy ve, where did the years go? Even the goyim who didn't grow up hearing Yiddish will love this book	.

N This attractively illustrated book provides a showcase of Israel's achievements in fields as diverse as agriculture, education, medicine, science and technology. It looks at the technologies, processes and the products from this tiny little land that are improving the lives of so many people. The authors highlight some of the people responsible for this ingenuity that is benefiting the whole world.<br /><br />For example, at the Weizmann Institute, Dr Michal Schwartz has developed a way of harnessing immune system cells to repair and revive damaged nerve fibres. Other medical breakthroughs include the miniscule camera-in-a-tablet used for internal diagnosis, ultrasound for destroying tumours and Israel's highly effective disaster relief operations.<br /><br />A great help to third world people has been the discovery by scientist Yoel Margalith of the Bti bacterium that kills certain kinds of flies and harmful mosquitoes.  This has already saved millions of livers and is an environment-friendly intervention. Most remarkable is that Margalith is a holocaust survivor, of both the Bergen-Belsen and Teresienstadt camps.<br /><br />In many fields Israel is so far ahead of the pack that other countries have no chance of catching up. One of the most interesting innovations developed in Israel is a project to avoid collisions between aircraft and migratory birds. It involved the study of the flight paths of birds. This work of researcher Yossi Leshem is now also used by the Jordanian and Turkish air-force.<br /><br />Israel has more engineers per capita than any other country on earth and a remarkable number of hi-tech companies. Innovation in the fields of computers and information technology is particularly impressive. This encompasses software, operating systems, storage & retrieval systems, verification and firewall technologies, plus a host of mobile phone applications.<br /><br />Israel's creativity is not restricted to science and technology, as there is also much happening in arts and culture. Despite its small size and its many enemies, this country is bursting with creative energy and making a huge contribution to the global marketplace and to quality of life worldwide.<br /><br />The founders of this brave country were aware that Israel had almost no natural resources and that its people therefore had to develop and apply their brainpower. Well, they are succeeding spectacularly. What a pity that Israel has to devote so much of its money and resources to protect itself from its neighbours! If its full genius were given free reign, it would become even more of a blessing to the world.ts small size and its many enemies, this country is bursting with creative energy and making a huge contribution to the global marketplace and to quality of life worldwide.

N \\"Last Chance to See\\" is Douglas Adams' hilarious and though-provoking non-fiction, eco-travel narrative about circling the globe in search of some of the Earth's most endangered animals. We get to see a side of Adams that is deeply concerned with the plight of the beautiful, unique, and often ludicrously implausible lifeforms on our planet -- the same side that prompted him to climb Mount Kilimanjaro in a rhino suit.     What made this book all the more meaningful to me was that I'd thought I'd finished all of Douglas Adams' books long ago. I loved them all, but I never fully appreciated the depth of his genius as a humanist and social satirist until, sadly, he had passed away.  What's more, I never realized how much Adams' writings meant to me until I was hit with the cold, hard reality that he'd written all he ever would.  Douglas Adams had hitched his last ride across the galaxy, and I'd never hear from him again.  Or so I thought.    Infinitely improbable as it may seem, I heard from Douglas Adams again about two weeks ago.  I was browsing around in Borders, long since resigned to the fact that I'd read the last \\"new\\" Douglas Adams book I ever would, when I stumbled upon \\"Last Chance to See.\\" I felt like I'd gone into the pet store to buy a parakeet and, instead, found a dodo bird.      The endangered species Douglas Adams criss-crossed the globe in search of are all, in their own ways, remarkable and priceless. He urges us not to wait until they're gone to fully appreciate them, and he drives this point home to today's readers, in his own ironic style, by now being himself \\"extinct.\\"    If you're a Douglas Adams fan, and you've never read this book, here it is -- your own \\"last chance to see\\" (or, rather, read) him.  His own voice, his own words, his own experiences.  For me, it was a fond farewell from an old friend I'd never met, who, from his new home -- far beyond life, the universe, and everything -- telling me, \\"Yes, I'm dead. But there are still a few rhinos and gorillas and dolphins that aren't. Do me a favor; make sure they stay that way.\\		"
N In a not too distant future, Angel is a certified Retribution Specialist (CRS), which means that when the law fails to bring justice, the victims can hire a CRS to bring in the perpetrator of the crime to them to enact their own justice.  When a closed case is reopened, Angel is again under investigation for \\"what happened\\" the night policeman Danny Black died.  On top of dealing with this, her mother, Lola, gets kidnapped, and Angel knows that if she doesn't rescue Lola herself, she might die. <br /> <br />Because she has Detective Marco following her and questioning her movements - from the past as well as during the events he witnesses personally, she starts finding things out about herself she really didn't want to know...like her exceptionally good luck.  It may not be luck after all; the physic abilities Lola has may actually be genuine and she inherited them.  <br /> <br />KISS OF THE BLUE DRAGON is the second story I've read by Julie Beard, and I actually like her writing style better here.  The story is written in first person, which can drive readers batty (me too upon occasion); however, it works here.  There is a different \\"feel\\" to KISS completely.  For me, I can \\"hear\\" a narrator filling in the details of Angels' activities.  So even though we, as a reader, only get to know her thoughts and impressions of what she sees, we still get to know what is going on around her.  You get to know Angel, what motivates her and see how she thinks very well.  I also really liked the fact that a lot of simple details of her life are included. <br />  <br />I will admit it was a close call as to whether I would like Angel or not.  She almost doesn't seem feminine.  However, if you read a little further into the book, you learn what her logic is, how she thinks but more importantly WHY.  Angel is tough, spunky, kick-butt heroine and out to help those unable to help themselves.  She is fearless and makes her decisions based on what is right rather than whether she willget hurt or not.  Angel is one busy lady.  She has cases that she maintains during the process of rescuing Lola and I liked the fact that Julie Beard didn't drop some of these issues, therefore the story stays three dimensional.   <br /> <br />While the reopened investigation is secondary to what is going on in her life, it is what brings our hero and heroine together.  I was happy with the chemistry between her and Detective Marco even if the bedroom scenes take place off of the books pages.   <br /> <br />I like the fact that even though KISS is a science-fiction romance, the author doesn't go out of her way to create objects that will stump the reader, or throw off the flow of the novel.  For an example: in a time where DNA left behind is what would keep you in jail, rather than using a hollow-tip bullet, a criminal would use a bullet filled with acid therefore destroying the evidence.   <br /> <br />KISS is technically supposed to be a romance, but with the way this story ends, we don't have our heroine hooking up with the hero.  Because Lola was kidnapped by one of the Chicago mobs there are still some unresolved issues that its sequel might wrap up.  Regardless, I didn't feel like major details were left out or the story wasn't well developed.  As a reader I didn't find myself wondering, \\"what just happened\\"?   <br /> <br />I found KISS OF THE BLUE DRAGON very interesting, and look forward to reading the further adventures of Angel in its sequel TOUCH OF THE WHITE TIGER.  So, if you are looking for something a little different, check out this story		!
Y National Geographic Traveler is the best series of its type, and the NGT Thailand book has the same standards of quality as all the others.  It provides an excellent mix of written descriptions and beautiful pictures, both of which are helpful in determining whether to include places on your trip itinerary.

N \\"Truth vs Falsehood\\" is Hawkins' 4th book. In my mind, it is his greatest gift yet, but not in the sense that one might think. This will be explained in the closing. I will also preface by saying that I am in no way political. Truth is all that I am interested in. <br />   In Hawkins' previous 3 books, the kinesiological response was portrayed as infallible. His language was very absolute in its tone, giving the technique more credibility than it has ever received. Being so absolute with one's tone was the first obvious clue. When one becomes absolute in their tone, they often put an inordinate amount of faith in something outside themselves and overlook the inherent limitations. This is true for everything from religious absolutism to the mythical cure-all in medicine. The person who uses the absolute tone acts as if your salvation lies with this one particular thing.  <br />   I am a traditional naturopath. I was using kinesiology before Hawkins' books, and I am closely connected to practitioners of kinesiology who've used it in excess of 20 years. An observant and curious practitioner quickly realizes that the intent of both the testee and tester influences response. In some cases, a strong-willed practitioner who thinks he knows the cause of imbalance or dis-ease is affecting testee response and in essence using kinesiology to validate his own opinions and beliefs, albeit unknowingly. He will get the positive response he desires, whereas the practitioner with no vested interest in anything except the truth will get a different response on the same testee.  <br />   It has been difficult for me to bridge the gap between Hawkins' theory/ doctoral thesis on his use of kinesiology and the understanding that most experienced practitioners of kinesiology have. Nearly all experienced practitioners simply don't find the technique to be infallible. Certain criteria must be met for accurate response. Those criteria are training, impartiality, and the sincere and humble desire to put absolute truth above all things. Truth is absolute, but the technique is not. Remaining neutral is an ongoing challenge for the practitioner. <br /> <br />   I am not familiar with the testing methods used for Hawkins' doctoral thesis \\"Quantitative and Qualitative Calibration of the Levels of Consciousness\\". However, for it to withstand any scientific scrutiny, both the tester and testee would have to be without any knowledge on the subject matter. There would also have to be at least 20 different testers for the 3000+ test subjects, with each tester coming up with their own test responses to a given list of questions. Responses would not be compared until all testers have compiled their findings. For his thesis, something along these lines was most likely used.  <br />   Throughout \\"Power vs. Force\\", a healthy skepticism was maintained towards Hawkins putting so much faith in this technique. Part of this was based on an inability to get the same responses he was getting. The information presented in \\"The Eye of the I\\" and \\"I\\" was absolutely astounding, and skepticism was temporarily set aside. Apparently, his intent was pure and sincere enough to allow him to experience absolute truth on spiritual inquiry. Much of this can be attributed to his description of a life-changing experience. He was atheist (or possibly agnostic... don't remember which), hit a major crisis in his life, and finally called out in total humility to be shown the truth of God. I feel his pure intent allowed him to access the truth he did. <br />   However, once Hawkins gained confidence in the technique, he apparently fell into the trap of thinking he could divorce himself from influencing response. The methods used for gleaning the information found in \\"Truth vs Falsehood\\" would surely not withstand any scientific scrutiny. The simple fact that the subject matter was familiar to the tester(s) and testee(s) disqualifies it. Asking about the nature of life, death, and other unknown spiritual matters is not the same as asking about one's perceived reality, which one already has strong opinions and emotions about and attachments to. Both testers and testees would have to be completely unfamiliar with the line of inquiry to have any guarantee of neutrality. <br /> <br />   Within 30 seconds of opening \\"Truth vs Falsehood\\", it was clear something wasn't right. Hawkins' 3 previous books have helped us to discern truth from falsehood more clearly. Many of us have reached a place where now we `just know' the truth. It is often a clear gut feeling, and at that point the kinesiological response seems unnecessary. In a way, it turns out the technique was only a tool to guide us to our own inner knowing.  <br />   Hawkins acknowledges the existence of ignorance and untruth, but does not address the issue of deliberate deception. It is ironic that after years of devotion to the truth, Hawkins still does not fully grasp the nature of deception. The world citizenry is currently experiencing one of the most elaborate mass brainwashes in history.  <br />   In fact, Hawkins even engages in deception when he explains the Iraq situation. He indicates that the primary reason to be there is to protect the world's (and specifically America's) economic and oil interests. Yet the primary reason given to the public for going to war was weapons of mass destruction. Whether or not it was a fact that there were actually WMDs misses the point. It was given as the main reason, and it was not. That is deception. For Hawkins to agree with the idea of justifiable deceptions is a clear indicator that he is not neutral here. <br />   More importantly, for Hawkins to act as if outright deception is not occurring speaks to one's ability to deal with reality. For a person with 80 years of conditioned perception of reality to have reality turned on its head, a person could have a serious breakdown. <br /> <br />   The gift in this 4th book is that Hawkins has shown us what thekinesiological technique can and cannot be used for. It can be used by the sincere truthseeker for his/herself. However, it is not to be used to show one a reality they are not ready to see. There is no technique to make one see the truth. One's clear and sincere intention is all that can do that. And even then, one may not be ready to handle the fullness of reality. The process of how one \\"wakes up\\" is yet to be known. <br />   Who better than Hawkins to show us that experience is no substitute for impartiality? So, the readers of his 4th book get the opportunity to discern what is truth and what is his belief. The first 3 books prepared us, and the 4th is the test. Although he didn't intend it to work this way, it is the greatest gift of all. And just as importantly, it shows us that one can be quite enlightened in one area, while not having it all together in another. Even when one crosses the 600 line, one is still assailed by falsity and ignorance and must be constantly vigilant and unattached to one's beliefs.  <br /> <br />   And realistically, it couldn't have happened any other way. Given Hawkins' first 3 books and his audience, if he gave us the absolute truth about all the deceptions that make up the current perceived reality, it could have seriously messed some people up. It could result in serious mental breakdown if it was said that there aren't actually arab terrorists creating terror in America. So, the book had to be presented this way. And those of us who know the real truth know it through our own inner knowing already and don't need Hawkins to tell us. <br />   In `The Art of War', Sun Tzu said, \\"All warfare is based on deception.\\" Well, currently we have warfare in nearly every form. Even `necessary' and `justified' wars have deception as their roots. <br /> <br />Michael <br />Santa Fe, New Mexic		o
Y It is to Jane Hyun's credit to discuss issues of Asian American professionals on a very practical level. There are however, some caveats for the reader. The book needs to be contextualized within a larger conceptual framework. The overarching issues are ignored within her practical framework, namely: Who needs to change? Who needs to accommodate whom?  How much? What are the risks and benefits? Her book appears to be saying that corporate America needs to understand Asians, but it does not need to change.  Rather it is the Asian professional that needs to change and adapt. <br /> <br />Is the book too heavily assimilationist?  It is not clear as Hyun does make a distinction early in her book between assimilation (\\"adopting ...at the expense of one's own cultural characteristics\\") and acculturation (\\"adapting ...while continuing to maintain values, perspectives, and features of one's native culture\\"). <br /> <br />There appears to be little adaptation of any Asian models or perspective to the mainstream USA corporate culture -- page 279 suggests two ways: \\"Develop cultural competency\\" and \\"Make use of your bicultural and bilingual abilities.\\" While recognizing the dominance of USA/Western research and models in the business world, it is also logical and no \\"one model fits all.\\" Perhaps future research and practices can provide indigenous Asian models or perspectives that can be adapted and work effectively in coporate America or other cultures.  The Special Issue on China & India (Business Week, August 22/29, 2005) points out how some USA business models are not applicable. <br /> <br />It is not an either/or proposition.  By utilizing the juxtaposition of the Asian behavior/values system versus the Western behavior/values system to present her central thesis, Hyun creates a false dichotomy in the mind of the reader. Current business literature is filled with exhortations of \\"win/win,\\" \\"both/and,\\" \\"alignment,\\" and \\"interdependence\\" -- all very Asian concepts. These traditional Asian cultural values are at the very heart of what contemporary corporate America is trying to effect in order to add value. So there is a \\"baby with the bath water\\" caveat here to the reader.  The accommodation needs to be reciprocal, not unilateral. <br /> <br />In her Epilogue, Hyun encourages the reader to \\"Develop an Action Plan That Works with Your Persona.\\"  It seems throughout her book that the emphasis is on asking the reader to tailor his or her persona to that which is required for success in corporate America, not on utilizing the behavioral strengths and cognitive positions with which someone who comes with a strong Asian cultural background is imbued.  Being Asian -- it seems to Hyun -- puts one in a deficit position. <br /> <br />The reader needs to be cautious in the self-assessment, individual profiles, exercises and tools cited. They yield helpful descriptive self-awareness profiles and information, not diagnostic or predictive profiles, and they are dependent on situational factors. There are many suggestions, based perhaps on many years of experience, but empirical data demonstrating their reliability, validity or efficacy are not mentioned. <br /> <br />Kudos to Hyun for encouraging the seeking of regular and frequent performance feedback. This is a career self-monitoring technique that is utilized far too little by all employees to help document and strengthen requests for job and salary advancement.  In spite of the conceptual conundrums, this highly practical book is a must read. <br /> <br />Adrian Chan (Kochman Mavrelis Associates, Oak Park, IL) & Barry Mar (Management & Resources Associates, Seattle, WA) <br /		>
N Dobson begins her easy-to-read book with chapters appropriately titled \\"Helping Your Child Love Learning\\" and \\"Creating Your Own Educational Reform\\". After reading just these two chapters I was already in love with the book.<br /><br />The remaining chapters consist of reader contributed ideas, lessons and games. These parents know how to make education so fun the kids probably won't even know they are learning! The ideas are easy, fast, inexpensive, and usually involve minimal research.<br /><br />What really makes this book stand far and above others is Table 2.2, found on pages 34-37. This helpful table lists many popular off-the-shelf curriculums that can be easily recreated at home with materials you already have, or can be found used - all for under $100!<br /><br />This book is truly ingenious! It's about time someone organized the ideas of creative parents into one handy reference. I cannot think of a better person to present this material other a personal favorite, Linda Dobson		.
N I've read almost every book written on the Beatles and found Cynthia's story poignant and from the heart.  She's had a hard time finding her true self in the shadows of her larger-than-life men and marriages and she persists despite the setbacks and enjoys the adventures. <br /> <br />The first half of the book is almost identical to her earlier book, Twist of Lennon in 1989.  I've not read much about her or Julian from 1980 on and it is interesting to look at behind-the-scenes reflections vs. what the public sees.  Julian: Sing again in your own key and forget about Them. <br /> <br />If you are a '42-years And Counting' Beatles fan like me, then  you will enjoy this book.  There are some unreleased pictues you'll relish from Cyn's family album. <br /> <br />All You Need Is Love, oh yeah, yet there wuz a lot of hurtin' souls along Penny Lane besides Eleanor Rigby or Sgt. Pepper. The price of fame which is not fleeting here. <br /> <br />Donna Coulso		n
N I have searched and searched for a great Arthurian retelling and have been disappointed with the ones I have ventured into reading. I was somewhat skeptical when I picked up Nancy McKenzie's Queen of Camelot. This two-novels-in-one compilation is based on Guenevere, from her point of view, in first person narrative, and is 623 pages long in very small print. I didn't want to waste my time reading something this big only to be disappointed at the end. I nevertheless gave the book a whirl. Glad I did! This is one of the most compelling and beautifully told retells I have ever read! McKenzie gives us a detailed story about Guenevere from her point of view. She tells us about the prophecy on the day she was born, how she spends her childhood as an adventurous tomboy, how people fear her and treat her differently as she grows up, how the knights around her battle with the Saxons, and how all of the prophecies come true. She meets Arthur, marries him and later has a love affair with Lancelot, something based on the original tale. But the novel has so much more than that. You will see how this story of magic, prophecies, love and betrayal transpires in an altered, detailed and beautiful light. There are many twists throughout the novel.<br /><br />Guenevere is developed in such an abundant, three-dimensional way in this novel. She is no longer just the pagan beauty who marries a Christian, betrays him and destroys all of Camelot as a result. She is a complex character with flaws as well as virtues in this offering. Arthur is also written in a more interesting, compelling way here, but it is Lancelot that once again blows me away. I have always romanticized Sir Lancelot and McKenzie does not disappoint me in her version of the loyal, chivalrous knight. Merlin and Morgan Le Fay are written with much complexity and nuance as well. This novel, however, does not focus so much on the love triangle between Guenevere, Arthur and Lancelot as much as her inability to supply an heir for Arthur and her affection for Arthur's bastard son, the traitorous Mordred. The overall story is magnificent. Once again, I say that McKenzie did a wonderful job bringing Guenevere to life. She turns this character into a strong, intelligent, complex, three-dimensional, flesh and blood woman, someone you will feel a great deal of affinity with. She is not portrayed as a simple-minded, traitorous hussy in this one! I loved the fanciful storytelling style that made me turn the pages until the wee hours of the night. Some of my friends who read the book along with me complained about it being too long-winded. I didn't think it was long-winded at all. In fact, I wish it had been longer. I loved this book and I look forward to giving Grail Prince a whirl.for Arthur and her affection for Arthur's bastard son, the traitorous Mordred. The overall story is magnificent.

This is one of those books that will stir you up, make you ask questions, and allow you to accept the answers. My review will be posted after the George Noory interview..		.
N I was hoping that the book would be better than the television show, and it wasn't. The show, with its amusing quips, puns and overreaching pseudointellectual analyses of female behavior, is entertaining in a vegetative sort of way. The book should have had more depth. Yes, I'm sure there are women in NYC who claim to be looking for love as they hop from bed to bed hoping to change men into what they want. I hope to high Heaven that the denizens of real NYC are nothing like the flaky women in Candace Bushnell's Sex In The City. Mr. Big is just as egregious in the book as he's portrayed in the HBO show. On the plus side, Patricial Field does a great job with Carrie's wardrobe on the show		.
Y Champlin bravely asserts his own contribution to the great wealth of Neronian scholarship for the critics to pick apart. I find very little to quibble about.<br />It is difficult to write even-handedly about Nero for a Western audience. Who could forget the image of a man who \\"fiddled while Rome burned\\" or the terrible tyrant who had begun a nearly 170 year \\"persecution\\" of the early Christians, under whose reign both Peter and Paul were executed? As other reviewer comments reveal, you can easily earn the brand of a Nero \\"apologist\\" if you don't tow the party line, however inaccurate it might be.<br /><br />Champlin's thesis can be stated simply as follows: many, if not most of Nero's grandstands and outrageous actions, were performed out of considerable political shrewdness and calculation - not the madness or puerile excess wrongly attributed to a \\"live fast, die young, and leave a good looking corpse\\" emperor. Nero's success, Champlin argues in the first chapter, is evinced by a shockingly prolonged \\"afterlife\\" manifested in pseudo-Neros, Judeo-Christian apocalyptic writings, and a disenfranchised populace openly lamenting his death. Nonetheless, I cannot help but wonder, (working on the same assumption,) whether he had truly orchestrated his public relations as well as Champlin suggests given his untimely demise at age 30.<br /><br />Some reviewers disagree, but I reckon Champlin's original Nero-Periander link to be one of the most intriguing ideas in ancient biography I've ever seen. The ambivalent relationship with the mother, the Philhellenism, the artistic bent, and the numerous other links are too compelling to ignore outright, even if the conclusion a hard sell. Further research is warranted, but I suspect that Champlin, with his great intellect and energy, may have already exhausted all of the available evidence for advancing his thesis. He demonstrates the Augustus/Antony connections thoroughly. The discussion of the great fire of 64 is arrestingly well done: after convincingly presenting the defense for Nero's innocence, he suddenly shatters the deception in stating that despite this preceding evidence, Nero undoubtedly held direct responsibility for the coflagration. It hits you with dramatic effect almost equal to one of the primary sources comprising the centerpiece of his proof in this sudden reversal: Tacitus' Annales XV.67.<br /><br />Champlin's organization is somewhat bothersome as it is in \\"Final Judgments,\\" because he rejects chronological arrangement for thematic foci. This requires repetition of several facts, and I cannot understand his reasons for the chapter order. The post-mortem legacy of Nero, being most fascinating, he puts up front obviously to hook his reader. It serves as an interesting set piece for further discourse, because the inevitable wonder we feel about Nero's impression on the world ever after demands explanation: thus the rest of the book. But with Dio, Suetonius, and Tacitus unfolding the bulk of their own histories so methodically, the rearrangement isn't always a neat fit. Still, Champlin's brilliant weaving together of hundreds of sources, as before, vindicates his literary decisions several times over.<br /><br />Champlin, like any other historian, has his hypotheses and directs his evidence toward proving them. His presentation however, is replete with past scholarship and primary sources presented candidly and fairly. One of the most appreciable inclusions is the extensive collection of Latin graffiti, which add a critical dimension to our knowledge. This book has been for me an introduction into full-strength Neronian scholarship and I found it both accessible and empowering enough to read further with confidence.ngly presenting the defense for Nero's innocence, he suddenly shatters the deception in stating that despite this preceding evidence, Nero undoubtedly held direct responsibility for the coflagration.

N While I don't always agree with his TV analysis, I enjoy Mr. Crawford's commentaries. His book, however, is surprisingly shallow and can be summed up in one chapter with footnotes. I didn't realize an intentional misquoting of Thomas Jefferson on page 2 (easy enough to catch as the footnote provides the actual quote) was a foreshadowing of the paraphrasing to come. Almost all his sources are the very media he criticizes.    Yes, the media should be astute and critical of anyone in power anywhere, yet it isn't, mostly because it has been corporatized. vilified and because reporters and organizations have wimped out. OK, yes, and....?     Since Crawford is a journalist, one who claims an inside view of what really goes on, he is obligated by the same standards he poses not just to say this is what went on, but to explain why manipulation is allowed and what to do about it. Tom Fenton in his book, Bad News, does a more thorough job of explaining the links between money and reporting and providing a context for media manipulation and journalistic reticence.     Crawford gives specific examples of manipulation, but doesn't provide motive or context beyond the trite \\"politicians manipulate the media so they can look better so they can become powerful.\\" Therein lies the point, if the media is powerful enough that it needs to be manipulated, then it is powerful enough to hold its own. Why hasn't the media held its own and why aren't people demanding a real public discussion? What does the messenger do with the message he was supposed to deliver?    Crawford says people are tuning to outlets to verify their beliefs so news outlets are becoming customer-driven reinforcing agents. If that's true, why is the media making that choice instead of taking the lead? Politicians do attack the messenger, but often they don't have to, because the messenger has been co-opted. More dangerously, by giving hyperbole public time and space, the news media cuts its own throat then calls it a tracheotomy.    Still, despite the flaws, I stayed with the book's limited scope until page 117. \\"I don't vote....\\" With that, Crawford's credibility flew out the window.     \\"I fear it will make it more difficult to keep my observations down the middle.\\" After 116 pages of caterwalling about professional and personal responsibility, about the consequences to democracy of a media manipulated by power, about how the media is responsible to its constituents, the public, and should judge both the quality and importance of its \\"message,\\" Crawford absolves himself of any duty, responsibility or personal judgment. His book becomes a version of \\"do as I say, not as I do.\\" Worse yet, the core of his argument is a tautology: journalists must give up the rights and responsibilities of citizenship to uphold the rights and responsibilitites of citizenship. Talk about attacking the messenger, the messenger just committed suicide.     Come on, get in the muck with the rest of us, make tough decisions, make judgments. It's in the choosing that one gains perspective and insight. Not voting because you're a journalist is like saying a Yankee fan can't write about baseball or deciding not to eat anything, ever, so no one will know you don't like brocolli.    As Jim Hightower put it, \\"There ain't nothin' in the middle of the road but yellow stripes and dead armadillos.\\		"
N Mr. Andersons' book provides a thorough examination, diagnosis, and best possible cure for what ails black america. Not poor whites, hispanics, arabs, jews, gays, or white women. You owe it to you and your family to at least check out the facts of this examination and then decide.  <br /> <br />White america has always put their modus operandi in our face; this is our society, these are our rules, do the best you can with what we decide to give you; don't bother me while I make my money. If you do, the police will handle you. <br /> <br />Here is Black americas' call to focus on what should have been the legacy of civil rights - economic empowerment		.
Y This book has been fascinating to read. It is evident, as a student of comparative religion, that the author has done some careful research and integrated it successfully in the book. A lot has to be said for some major research flaws, such as often referring to Sufis (Islamic mystics) and Mosques, even though Islam wasn't to arrive for another 650 years! Overall, it is an entertaining book and will provide you with an interesting alternative for the life of Jesus, an alternative that is likely, not fictional.<br /><br />Enjoy, but do filter the content		.

N Though she is honored to be Chicago Woman of the Year, Victoria Colby-Camp is more euphoric over the mental improvement that her son Jim has shown recently especially since he and Tasha North fell in love.  Jim was snatched almost twenty years ago when he was seven and turned into the killing Seth whose goal was to murder Victoria for abandoning him.  However, her elation would turn to despair if she knew Seth resurfaced and started to rape a pregnant Tasha.<br /><br />Former military strategist Daniel Marks is in town complements of the Colby Agency that wants to hire him.  Also in Chicago is Emily Hastings whose father a veteran homicide detective was murdered.  She finds letters linking her dad to Victoria, the woman's long ago murdered first husband James, and her dad's first partner Marelyn Rutland that confuses her.  Soon she will meet Daniel and they will be embroiled in the COLBY CONSPIRACY that goes back almost two decades ago.<br /><br />Though the subplots can become confusing at first, once the audience comprehends how this complex superb suspense thriller starts to come together, they will want more Colby Agency tales; (see FILES FROM THE COLBY AGENCY: THE BODYGUARD'S BABY PROTECTIVE CUSTODY).  The ensemble cast is solid as fans will feel with Victoria who has overcome so much tragedy, hope Jim \\"defeats\\" Seth with Tasha at his side, and root for Daniel and Emily to make it while wondering what really happened two decades ago.  A final twist marks a strong Webb of deceit tale that showcases a fine author on her A-game.<br /><br />Harriet Klausne		r
N When looking for &lt;a href=\\"[...]\\">lock picking books&lt;/a>, this one is very informative. It will give one great ideas on opening padlocks, but the language is very basic, no frills here. This is not a romance novel, it's how to open locks without keys, and that's it. You will learn what you need to here. But you should always seek out more knowledge		.
Y Never been much for enjoying history, but the style, brevity, and choice of subject matter come together very nicely in this book		.

Y At last... a comprehensive visual compendium of the most celebrated artistic promotional film marketing campaign worldwide... almost.  You would think that the opulent Mr. Sansweet would have in his possession every single poster to have ever rolled off the printing press for this unprecedented franchise but several of my favorite foreign one-sheets, daybills, banners and bus stop posters are notably missing.  Does this mean that Mr. Sansweet has not aquired all of them in his envious collection of Star Wars memorabilia?  Not likely.  Chances are he has every single one of them... locked away somewhere within the bowels of his coveted archives.  Most notably absent is the lack of reference material specifically promoting Revenge of the Sith and would seem to indicate that this book was completed and ready to be published just prior to the film's theatrical exhibition, but there is a plethora of wonderful international promotional material such as the six character U.K. bus stop posters that are much more visually exciting than the disappointing U.S. domestic ad campaign that demands to be published.  This can only mean that another volume must be sure to follow.  Still, there are enough international poster variations out there to keep collectors like myself and presumably Mr. Sansweet himself scouring the farthest reaches of the globe and the galaxy for years to come		.

Y At last... a comprehensive visual compendium of the most celebrated artistic promotional film marketing campaign worldwide... almost.  You would think that the opulent Mr. Sansweet would have in his possession every single poster to have ever rolled off the printing press for this unprecedented franchise but several of my favorite foreign one-sheets, daybills, banners and bus stop posters are notably missing.  Does this mean that Mr. Sansweet has not aquired all of them in his envious collection of Star Wars memorabilia?  Not likely.  Chances are he has every single one of them... locked away somewhere within the bowels of his coveted archives.  Most notably absent is the lack of reference material specifically promoting Revenge of the Sith and would seem to indicate that this book was completed and ready to be published just prior to the film's theatrical exhibition, but there is a plethora of wonderful international promotional material such as the six character U.K. bus stop posters that are much more visually exciting than the disappointing U.S. domestic ad campaign that demands to be published.  This can only mean that another volume must be sure to follow.  Still, there are enough international poster variations out there to keep collectors like myself and presumably Mr. Sansweet himself scouring the farthest reaches of the globe and the galaxy for years

N During the reign of Henry VIII, at fourteen Elizabeth Meredith inherited Friarsgate when her mother and older middle sister married and moved onto their respective spouses' estate and her oldest sibling and her husband chose the king's court.  Eight years later she remains independent running her estate until her mother informs her she must marry so that an heir can inherit Friarsgate.<br /><br />Her beloved sixty years old Uncle Thomas agrees to escort the feisty landowner to court.  However, before they leave for London, Baen MacColl comes from Scotland at the behest of his father to discus a sheep deal.  As the two die in the wool anti-marital soul mates fall in love, Elizabeth chaperoned by her uncle travels to the king's court.  There she befriends the beleaguered queen while Henry VIII begins his campaign to replace his wife Katherine with Anne.<br /><br />The key to this battle between two independent obstinate loving combatants is the background that incorporates Henry's antics as he sets in motion his plan to remove Katherine of Aragon as queen and replace her with Anne Boleyn.  Bertrice Small cleverly uses the monumental sixteenth century events to tell her story of love yet in some ways the shadow overwhelms the lead characters.  Fans of historical romance with strong doses of both will enjoy the latest Meredith tale (see UNTIL YOU AND PHILIPPA).<br /><br />Harriet Klausne

N The Outlander series are my favorite books of all time, period.  But after reading the Fiery Cross, I was a bit let down, as many people were, and afraid that the rest of the series would just continue to go downhill.  So when A Breath of Snow and Ashes came out, I was so glad to see that it was getting good reviews.  I finally got to read it this week and was not disappointed in the least. <br />All the characters we know and love are back, and Brianna seems to have finally grow up.  She has been my least favorite character since the second book, but this time around she was actually likeable (for the most part).  At certain points this book became so intense that I actually had to put it down and take a break for awhile, but not all readers will have this experience, only ones that are practically obsessed with this series (and who's friends have to remind them, \\"Jamie is NOT a real person!).    <br />So basically, if you have read the previous books, just read this one. Please.  You won't regret it.  The only reason I didn't give this one five stars is that I think nothing can top Outlander and Dragonfly in Amber.  If I could give this 4.5, I would. <br /> <br />One thing I have wondered about - if Claire dies back in the 1700's, then she'll be born again in 1918, go back in time in 1946, die in the 1700's, be born in 1918, and just keep repeating this forever.  For all she knows this could be her tenth time doing this.  I haven't seen this matter dealt with in the books.  Did I just miss it or something

Again, I am amazed and appreciative of the amount of research that Mr. Parry puts into his novels, and this book is a prime example.

N The premise of the book is hilarious: Dick and Jane, all grown up and still living in suburbia. But this isn't the suburbia of Ward and June Cleaver. It's the suburbia of \\"Desperate Housewives\\" with a Yiddish twist.<br /><br />It made me nostalgic for my years living in Miami Beach. Oy ve, where did the years go? Even the goyim who didn't grow up hearing Yiddish will love this book

N This attractively illustrated book provides a showcase of Israel's achievements in fields as diverse as agriculture, education, medicine, science and technology. It looks at the technologies, processes and the products from this tiny little land that are improving the lives of so many people. The authors highlight some of the people responsible for this ingenuity that is benefiting the whole world.<br /><br />For example, at the Weizmann Institute, Dr Michal Schwartz has developed a way of harnessing immune system cells to repair and revive damaged nerve fibres. Other medical breakthroughs include the miniscule camera-in-a-tablet used for internal diagnosis, ultrasound for destroying tumours and Israel's highly effective disaster relief operations.<br /><br />A great help to third world people has been the discovery by scientist Yoel Margalith of the Bti bacterium that kills certain kinds of flies and harmful mosquitoes.  This has already saved millions of livers and is an environment-friendly intervention. Most remarkable is that Margalith is a holocaust survivor, of both the Bergen-Belsen and Teresienstadt camps.<br /><br />In many fields Israel is so far ahead of the pack that other countries have no chance of catching up. One of the most interesting innovations developed in Israel is a project to avoid collisions between aircraft and migratory birds. It involved the study of the flight paths of birds. This work of researcher Yossi Leshem is now also used by the Jordanian and Turkish air-force.<br /><br />Israel has more engineers per capita than any other country on earth and a remarkable number of hi-tech companies. Innovation in the fields of computers and information technology is particularly impressive. This encompasses software, operating systems, storage & retrieval systems, verification and firewall technologies, plus a host of mobile phone applications.<br /><br />Israel's creativity is not restricted to science and technology, as there is also much happening in arts and culture. Despite its small size and its many enemies, this country is bursting with creative energy and making a huge contribution to the global marketplace and to quality of life worldwide.<br /><br />The founders of this brave country were aware that Israel had almost no natural resources and that its people therefore had to develop and apply their brainpower. Well, they are succeeding spectacularly. What a pity that Israel has to devote so much of its money and resources to protect itself from its neighbours! If its full genius were given free reign, it would become even more of a blessing to the world.ts small size and its many enemies, this country is bursting with creative energy and making a huge contribution to the global marketplace and to quality of life worldwide.

If its full genius were given free reign, it would become even more of a blessing to the world                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        .
N \\"Last Chance to See\\" is Douglas Adams' hilarious and though-provoking non-fiction, eco-travel narrative about circling the globe in search of some of the Earth's most endangered animals. We get to see a side of Adams that is deeply concerned with the plight of the beautiful, unique, and often ludicrously implausible lifeforms on our planet -- the same side that prompted him to climb Mount Kilimanjaro in a rhino suit.     What made this book all the more meaningful to me was that I'd thought I'd finished all of Douglas Adams' books long ago. I loved them all, but I never fully appreciated the depth of his genius as a humanist and social satirist until, sadly, he had passed away.  What's more, I never realized how much Adams' writings meant to me until I was hit with the cold, hard reality that he'd written all he ever would.  Douglas Adams had hitched his last ride across the galaxy, and I'd never hear from him again.  Or so I thought.    Infinitely improbable as it may seem, I heard from Douglas Adams again about two weeks ago.  I was browsing around in Borders, long since resigned to the fact that I'd read the last \\"new\\" Douglas Adams book I ever would, when I stumbled upon \\"Last Chance to See.\\" I felt like I'd gone into the pet store to buy a parakeet and, instead, found a dodo bird.      The endangered species Douglas Adams criss-crossed the globe in search of are all, in their own ways, remarkable and priceless. He urges us not to wait until they're gone to fully appreciate them, and he drives this point home to today's readers, in his own ironic style, by now being himself \\"extinct.\\"    If you're a Douglas Adams fan, and you've never read this book, here it is -- your own \\"last chance to see\\" (or, rather, read) him.  His own voice, his own words, his own experiences.  For me, it was a fond farewell from an old friend I'd never met, who, from his new home -- far beyond life, the universe, and everything -- telling me, \\"Yes, I'm dead. But there are still a few rhinos and gorillas and dolphins that aren't. Do me a favor; make sure they stay that way.\\

N In a not too distant future, Angel is a certified Retribution Specialist (CRS), which means that when the law fails to bring justice, the victims can hire a CRS to bring in the perpetrator of the crime to them to enact their own justice.  When a closed case is reopened, Angel is again under investigation for \\"what happened\\" the night policeman Danny Black died.  On top of dealing with this, her mother, Lola, gets kidnapped, and Angel knows that if she doesn't rescue Lola herself, she might die. <br /> <br />Because she has Detective Marco following her and questioning her movements - from the past as well as during the events he witnesses personally, she starts finding things out about herself she really didn't want to know...like her exceptionally good luck.  It may not be luck after all; the physic abilities Lola has may actually be genuine and she inherited them.  <br /> <br />KISS OF THE BLUE DRAGON is the second story I've read by Julie Beard, and I actually like her writing style better here.  The story is written in first person, which can drive readers batty (me too upon occasion); however, it works here.  There is a different \\"feel\\" to KISS completely.  For me, I can \\"hear\\" a narrator filling in the details of Angels' activities.  So even though we, as a reader, only get to know her thoughts and impressions of what she sees, we still get to know what is going on around her.  You get to know Angel, what motivates her and see how she thinks very well.  I also really liked the fact that a lot of simple details of her life are included. <br />  <br />I will admit it was a close call as to whether I would like Angel or not.  She almost doesn't seem feminine.  However, if you read a little further into the book, you learn what her logic is, how she thinks but more importantly WHY.  Angel is tough, spunky, kick-butt heroine and out to help those unable to help themselves.  She is fearless and makes her decisions based on what is right rather than whether she willget hurt or not.  Angel is one busy lady.  She has cases that she maintains during the process of rescuing Lola and I liked the fact that Julie Beard didn't drop some of these issues, therefore the story stays three dimensional.   <br /> <br />While the reopened investigation is secondary to what is going on in her life, it is what brings our hero and heroine together.  I was happy with the chemistry between her and Detective Marco even if the bedroom scenes take place off of the books pages.   <br /> <br />I like the fact that even though KISS is a science-fiction romance, the author doesn't go out of her way to create objects that will stump the reader, or throw off the flow of the novel.  For an example: in a time where DNA left behind is what would keep you in jail, rather than using a hollow-tip bullet, a criminal would use a bullet filled with acid therefore destroying the evidence.   <br /> <br />KISS is technically supposed to be a romance, but with the way this story ends, we don't have our heroine hooking up with the hero.  Because Lola was kidnapped by one of the Chicago mobs there are still some unresolved issues that its sequel might wrap up.  Regardless, I didn't feel like major details were left out or the story wasn't well developed.  As a reader I didn't find myself wondering, \\"what just happened\\"?   <br /> <br />I found KISS OF THE BLUE DRAGON very interesting, and look forward to reading the further adventures of Angel in its sequel TOUCH OF THE WHITE TIGER.  So, if you are looking for something a little different, check out this story                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               !
Y National Geographic Traveler is the best series of its type, and the NGT Thailand book has the same standards of quality as all the others.  It provides an excellent mix of written descriptions and beautiful pictures, both of which are helpful in determining whether to include places on your trip itinerary.  The only flaw is that the hotel and meal section is not particularly useful

N \\"Truth vs Falsehood\\" is Hawkins' 4th book. In my mind, it is his greatest gift yet, but not in the sense that one might think. This will be explained in the closing. I will also preface by saying that I am in no way political. Truth is all that I am interested in. <br />   In Hawkins' previous 3 books, the kinesiological response was portrayed as infallible. His language was very absolute in its tone, giving the technique more credibility than it has ever received. Being so absolute with one's tone was the first obvious clue. When one becomes absolute in their tone, they often put an inordinate amount of faith in something outside themselves and overlook the inherent limitations. This is true for everything from religious absolutism to the mythical cure-all in medicine. The person who uses the absolute tone acts as if your salvation lies with this one particular thing.  <br />   I am a traditional naturopath. I was using kinesiology before Hawkins' books, and I am closely connected to practitioners of kinesiology who've used it in excess of 20 years. An observant and curious practitioner quickly realizes that the intent of both the testee and tester influences response. In some cases, a strong-willed practitioner who thinks he knows the cause of imbalance or dis-ease is affecting testee response and in essence using kinesiology to validate his own opinions and beliefs, albeit unknowingly. He will get the positive response he desires, whereas the practitioner with no vested interest in anything except the truth will get a different response on the same testee.  <br />   It has been difficult for me to bridge the gap between Hawkins' theory/ doctoral thesis on his use of kinesiology and the understanding that most experienced practitioners of kinesiology have. Nearly all experienced practitioners simply don't find the technique to be infallible. Certain criteria must be met for accurate response. Those criteria are training, impartiality, and the sincere and humble desire to put absolute truth above all things. Truth is absolute, but the technique is not. Remaining neutral is an ongoing challenge for the practitioner. <br /> <br />   I am not familiar with the testing methods used for Hawkins' doctoral thesis \\"Quantitative and Qualitative Calibration of the Levels of Consciousness\\". However, for it to withstand any scientific scrutiny, both the tester and testee would have to be without any knowledge on the subject matter. There would also have to be at least 20 different testers for the 3000+ test subjects, with each tester coming up with their own test responses to a given list of questions. Responses would not be compared until all testers have compiled their findings. For his thesis, something along these lines was most likely used.  <br />   Throughout \\"Power vs. Force\\", a healthy skepticism was maintained towards Hawkins putting so much faith in this technique. Part of this was based on an inability to get the same responses he was getting. The information presented in \\"The Eye of the I\\" and \\"I\\" was absolutely astounding, and skepticism was temporarily set aside. Apparently, his intent was pure and sincere enough to allow him to experience absolute truth on spiritual inquiry. Much of this can be attributed to his description of a life-changing experience. He was atheist (or possibly agnostic... don't remember which), hit a major crisis in his life, and finally called out in total humility to be shown the truth of God. I feel his pure intent allowed him to access the truth he did. <br />   However, once Hawkins gained confidence in the technique, he apparently fell into the trap of thinking he could divorce himself from influencing response. The methods used for gleaning the information found in \\"Truth vs Falsehood\\" would surely not withstand any scientific scrutiny. The simple fact that the subject matter was familiar to the tester(s) and testee(s) disqualifies it. Asking about the nature of life, death, and other unknown spiritual matters is not the same as asking about one's perceived reality, which one already has strong opinions and emotions about and attachments to. Both testers and testees would have to be completely unfamiliar with the line of inquiry to have any guarantee of neutrality. <br /> <br />   Within 30 seconds of opening \\"Truth vs Falsehood\\", it was clear something wasn't right. Hawkins' 3 previous books have helped us to discern truth from falsehood more clearly. Many of us have reached a place where now we `just know' the truth. It is often a clear gut feeling, and at that point the kinesiological response seems unnecessary. In a way, it turns out the technique was only a tool to guide us to our own inner knowing.  <br />   Hawkins acknowledges the existence of ignorance and untruth, but does not address the issue of deliberate deception. It is ironic that after years of devotion to the truth, Hawkins still does not fully grasp the nature of deception. The world citizenry is currently experiencing one of the most elaborate mass brainwashes in history.  <br />   In fact, Hawkins even engages in deception when he explains the Iraq situation. He indicates that the primary reason to be there is to protect the world's (and specifically America's) economic and oil interests. Yet the primary reason given to the public for going to war was weapons of mass destruction. Whether or not it was a fact that there were actually WMDs misses the point. It was given as the main reason, and it was not. That is deception. For Hawkins to agree with the idea of justifiable deceptions is a clear indicator that he is not neutral here. <br />   More importantly, for Hawkins to act as if outright deception is not occurring speaks to one's ability to deal with reality. For a person with 80 years of conditioned perception of reality to have reality turned on its head, a person could have a serious breakdown. <br /> <br />   The gift in this 4th book is that Hawkins has shown us what thekinesiological technique can and cannot be used for. It can be used by the sincere truthseeker for his/herself. However, it is not to be used to show one a reality they are not ready to see. There is no technique to make one see the truth. One's clear and sincere intention is all that can do that. And even then, one may not be ready to handle the fullness of reality. The process of how one \\"wakes up\\" is yet to be known. <br />   Who better than Hawkins to show us that experience is no substitute for impartiality? So, the readers of his 4th book get the opportunity to discern what is truth and what is his belief. The first 3 books prepared us, and the 4th is the test. Although he didn't intend it to work this way, it is the greatest gift of all. And just as importantly, it shows us that one can be quite enlightened in one area, while not having it all together in another. Even when one crosses the 600 line, one is still assailed by falsity and ignorance and must be constantly vigilant and unattached to one's beliefs.  <br /> <br />   And realistically, it couldn't have happened any other way. Given Hawkins' first 3 books and his audience, if he gave us the absolute truth about all the deceptions that make up the current perceived reality, it could have seriously messed some people up. It could result in serious mental breakdown if it was said that there aren't actually arab terrorists creating terror in America. So, the book had to be presented this way. And those of us who know the real truth know it through our own inner knowing already and don't need Hawkins to tell us. <br />   In `The Art of War', Sun Tzu said, \\"All warfare is based on deception.\\" Well, currently we have warfare in nearly every form. Even `necessary' and `justified' wars have deception as their roots. <br /> <br />Michael <br />Santa Fe, New Mexic  o
Y It is to Jane Hyun's credit to discuss issues of Asian American professionals on a very practical level. There are however, some caveats for the reader. The book needs to be contextualized within a larger conceptual framework. The overarching issues are ignored within her practical framework, namely: Who needs to change? Who needs to accommodate whom?  How much? What are the risks and benefits? Her book appears to be saying that corporate America needs to understand Asians, but it does not need to change.  Rather it is the Asian professional that needs to change and adapt. <br /> <br />Is the book too heavily assimilationist?  It is not clear as Hyun does make a distinction early in her book between assimilation (\\"adopting ...at the expense of one's own cultural characteristics\\") and acculturation (\\"adapting ...while continuing to maintain values, perspectives, and features of one's native culture\\"). <br /> <br />There appears to be little adaptation of any Asian models or perspective to the mainstream USA corporate culture -- page 279 suggests two ways: \\"Develop cultural competency\\" and \\"Make use of your bicultural and bilingual abilities.\\" While recognizing the dominance of USA/Western research and models in the business world, it is also logical and no \\"one model fits all.\\" Perhaps future research and practices can provide indigenous Asian models or perspectives that can be adapted and work effectively in coporate America or other cultures.  The Special Issue on China & India (Business Week, August 22/29, 2005) points out how some USA business models are not applicable. <br /> <br />It is not an either/or proposition.  By utilizing the juxtaposition of the Asian behavior/values system versus the Western behavior/values system to present her central thesis, Hyun creates a false dichotomy in the mind of the reader. Current business literature is filled with exhortations of \\"win/win,\\" \\"both/and,\\" \\"alignment,\\" and \\"interdependence\\" -- all very Asian concepts. These traditional Asian cultural values are at the very heart of what contemporary corporate America is trying to effect in order to add value. So there is a \\"baby with the bath water\\" caveat here to the reader.  The accommodation needs to be reciprocal, not unilateral. <br /> <br />In her Epilogue, Hyun encourages the reader to \\"Develop an Action Plan That Works with Your Persona.\\"  It seems throughout her book that the emphasis is on asking the reader to tailor his or her persona to that which is required for success in corporate America, not on utilizing the behavioral strengths and cognitive positions with which someone who comes with a strong Asian cultural background is imbued.  Being Asian -- it seems to Hyun -- puts one in a deficit position. <br /> <br />The reader needs to be cautious in the self-assessment, individual profiles, exercises and tools cited. They yield helpful descriptive self-awareness profiles and information, not diagnostic or predictive profiles, and they are dependent on situational factors. There are many suggestions, based perhaps on many years of experience, but empirical data demonstrating their reliability, validity or efficacy are not mentioned. <br /> <br />Kudos to Hyun for encouraging the seeking of regular and frequent performance feedback. This is a career self-monitoring technique that is utilized far too little by all employees to help document and strengthen requests for job and salary advancement.  In spite of the conceptual conundrums, this highly practical book is a must read. <br /> <br />Adrian Chan (Kochman Mavrelis Associates, Oak Park, IL) & Barry Mar (Management & Resources Associates, Seattle, WA) <br /                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  >
N Dobson begins her easy-to-read book with chapters appropriately titled \\"Helping Your Child Love Learning\\" and \\"Creating Your Own Educational Reform\\". After reading just these two chapters I was already in love with the book.<br /><br />The remaining chapters consist of reader contributed ideas, lessons and games. These parents know how to make education so fun the kids probably won't even know they are learning! The ideas are easy, fast, inexpensive, and usually involve minimal research.<br /><br />What really makes this book stand far and above others is Table 2.2, found on pages 34-37. This helpful table lists many popular off-the-shelf curriculums that can be easily recreated at home with materials you already have, or can be found used - all for under $100!<br /><br />This book is truly ingenious! It's about time someone organized the ideas of creative parents into one handy reference. I cannot think of a better person to present this material other a personal favorite, Linda Dobson

N I've read almost every book written on the Beatles and found Cynthia's story poignant and from the heart.  She's had a hard time finding her true self in the shadows of her larger-than-life men and marriages and she persists despite the setbacks and enjoys the adventures. <br /> <br />The first half of the book is almost identical to her earlier book, Twist of Lennon in 1989.  I've not read much about her or Julian from 1980 on and it is interesting to look at behind-the-scenes reflections vs. what the public sees.  Julian: Sing again in your own key and forget about Them. <br /> <br />If you are a '42-years And Counting' Beatles fan like me, then  you will enjoy this book.  There are some unreleased pictues you'll relish from Cyn's family album. <br /> <br />All You Need Is Love, oh yeah, yet there wuz a lot of hurtin' souls along Penny Lane besides Eleanor Rigby or Sgt. Pepper. The price of fame which is not fleeting here. <br /> <br />Donna Coulso

N I have searched and searched for a great Arthurian retelling and have been disappointed with the ones I have ventured into reading. I was somewhat skeptical when I picked up Nancy McKenzie's Queen of Camelot. This two-novels-in-one compilation is based on Guenevere, from her point of view, in first person narrative, and is 623 pages long in very small print. I didn't want to waste my time reading something this big only to be disappointed at the end. I nevertheless gave the book a whirl. Glad I did! This is one of the most compelling and beautifully told retells I have ever read! McKenzie gives us a detailed story about Guenevere from her point of view. She tells us about the prophecy on the day she was born, how she spends her childhood as an adventurous tomboy, how people fear her and treat her differently as she grows up, how the knights around her battle with the Saxons, and how all of the prophecies come true. She meets Arthur, marries him and later has a love affair with Lancelot, something based on the original tale. But the novel has so much more than that. You will see how this story of magic, prophecies, love and betrayal^C

N Though she is honored to be Chicago Woman of the Year, Victoria Colby-Camp is more euphoric over the mental improvement that her son Jim has shown recently especially since he and Tasha North fell in love.  Jim was snatched almost twenty years ago when he was seven and turned into the killing Seth whose goal was to murder Victoria for abandoning him.  However, her elation would turn to despair if she knew Seth resurfaced and started to rape a pregnant Tasha.<br /><br />Former military strategist Daniel Marks is in town complements of the Colby Agency that wants to hire him.  Also in Chicago is Emily Hastings whose father a veteran homicide detective was murdered.  She finds letters linking her dad to Victoria, the woman's long ago murdered first husband James, and her dad's first partner Marelyn Rutland that confuses her.  Soon she will meet Daniel and they will be embroiled in the COLBY CONSPIRACY that goes back almost two decades ago.<br /><br />Though the subplots can become confusing at first, once the audience comprehends how this complex superb suspense thriller starts to come together, they will want more Colby Agency tales; (see FILES FROM THE COLBY AGENCY: THE BODYGUARD'S BABY PROTECTIVE CUSTODY).  The ensemble cast is solid as fans will feel with Victoria who has overcome so much tragedy, hope Jim \\"defeats\\" Seth with Tasha at his side, and root for Daniel and Emily to make it while wondering what really happened two decades ago.  A final twist marks a strong Webb of deceit tale that showcases a fine author on her A-game.<br /><br />Harriet Klausne

Y At last... a comprehensive visual compendium of the most celebrated artistic promotional film marketing campaign worldwide... almost.  You would think that the opulent Mr. Sansweet would have in his possession every single poster to have ever rolled off the printing press for this unprecedented franchise but several of my favorite foreign one-sheets, daybills, banners and bus stop posters are notably missing.  Does this mean that Mr. Sansweet has not aquired all of them in his envious collection of Star Wars memorabilia?  Not likely.  Chances are he has every single one of them... locked away somewhere within the bowels of his coveted archives.  Most notably absent is the lack of reference material specifically promoting Revenge of the Sith and would seem to indicate that this book was completed and ready to be published just prior to the film's theatrical exhibition, but there is a plethora of wonderful international promotional material such as the six character U.K. bus stop posters that are much more visually exciting than the disappointing U.S. domestic ad campaign that demands to be published.  This can only mean that another volume must be sure to follow.  Still, there are enough international poster variations out there to keep collectors like myself and presumably Mr. Sansweet himself scouring the farthest reaches of the globe and the galaxy for years

N Though she is honored to be Chicago Woman of the Year, Victoria Colby-Camp is more euphoric over the mental improvement that her son Jim has shown recently especially since he and Tasha North fell in love.  Jim was snatched almost twenty years ago when he was seven and turned into the killing Seth whose goal was to murder Victoria for abandoning him.  However, her elation would turn to despair if she knew Seth resurfaced and started to rape a pregnant Tasha.<br /><br />Former military strategist Daniel Marks is in town complements of the Colby Agency that wants to hire him.  Also in Chicago is Emily Hastings whose father a veteran homicide detective was murdered.  She finds letters linking her dad to Victoria, the woman's long ago murdered first husband James, and her dad's first partner Marelyn Rutland that confuses her.  Soon she will meet Daniel and they will be embroiled in the COLBY CONSPIRACY that goes back almost two decades ago.<br /><br />Though the subplots can become confusing at first, once the audience comprehends how this complex superb suspense thriller starts to come together, they will want more Colby Agency tales; (see FILES FROM THE COLBY AGENCY: THE BODYGUARD'S BABY PROTECTIVE CUSTODY).  The ensemble cast is solid as fans will feel with Victoria who has overcome so much tragedy, hope Jim \\"defeats\\" Seth with Tasha at his side, and root for Daniel and Emily to make it while wondering what really happened two decades ago.  A final twist marks a strong Webb of deceit tale that showcases a fine author on her A-game.<br /><br />Harriet Klausne

N Review based on a cursory examination by University of Phoenix students in Philosophy 251.  <br />We have found the book to be well organized, and detailed. The structure placed the information in an easy to read and presentable manner. <br />The use of strong and sound proofs by experiment and examples supported the overall logic of reasoning in a clear and concise manner. <br />We have found the book to be well thought out and laid out so the reader can learn and follow what is being explained. <br /

N My only complaint is that this book was a bit repetative, and Holden's vocabulary only consists of 4 words: sonuvabitch, goddamn, lousy and phony. It was still quite humorous and the actual story was interesting.<br /><br />It was easy to read and to relate to, so you should pick it up if you're looking for a fun read. Some people complain about the lack of a plot, but to understand this book you need to read deeper into it. It's actually a lot more than some annoying kid's list of complaints about life.<br /><br />The story is about Holden Caulfield's coming of age and realizing that growing up is not a process that can be stopped. He had a lousy childhood, as he puts it, and wants to save other children from going though the things he experienced in his life. He is telling the story from a mental institution, which he was placed in after returning home from the fourth Prep school he had been kicked out of. He flashes back to the events leading up to his arrival at his home and tells the story of those 3 days

N this boook was a great one that you could learn from. it not only teaches the imponrtance of family and their values but it also deals with basic issues that teens and some kids even deal with.  this book is about 4 best friends who are for the first time in their lives spending their summer apart. one day they are all in one of the girls rooms and finds a pair of pants that were tucked away in her closet.  once all four  of them try them on they realize that there is really something special about these pants.  seeming as how all 4 girls are differnt shapes and sizes and somehow the pants fit all of them,  they realize that these pants were the start of something special.  immediatley following they decided to make up certian rules abut the pants such as you must write the best thing u did while wearing the pants over your summer on the right leg and also some silly things such as to \\"never pick yuor nose while wearing the pants.\\"  this book follows the girls throuh their summers in differnt places of the world and through all of the different obstacles that life takes them through. it can really teach you alot not only about what is going on around you but most imporntantly about yuorself.  i would give this book 4 stars and would reccommend it to anyone who seems the slihgtest bit interested.
N If you are looking for something to stimulate your brain, this isn't it.  However, if you are just looking for a good laugh, you'll enjoy The Bad Girl's Guide.  It's funny and light, and definitely a good way to pass a little bit of time.
N never read it-a young relative idicated he liked it and somehow my name popped upon this--no more to say
N Though she is honored to be Chicago Woman of the Year, Victoria Colby-Camp is more euphoric over the mental improvement that her son Jim has shown recently especially since he and Tasha North fell in love.  Jim was snatched almost twenty years ago when he was seven and turned into the killing Seth whose goal was to murder Victoria for abandoning him.  However, her elation would turn to despair if she knew Seth resurfaced and started to rape a pregnant Tasha.<br /><br />Former military strategist Daniel Marks is in town complements of the Colby Agency that wants to hire him.  Also in Chicago is Emily Hastings whose father a veteran homicide detective was murdered.  She finds letters linking her dad to Victoria, the woman's long ago murdered first husband James, and her dad's first partner Marelyn Rutland that confuses her.  Soon she will meet Daniel and they will be embroiled in the COLBY CONSPIRACY that goes back almost two decades ago.<br /><br />Though the subplots can become confusing at first, once the audience comprehends how this complex superb suspense thriller starts to come together, they will want more Colby Agency tales; (see FILES FROM THE COLBY AGENCY: THE BODYGUARD'S BABY PROTECTIVE CUSTODY).  The ensemble cast is solid as fans will feel with Victoria who has overcome so much tragedy, hope Jim \\"defeats\\" Seth with Tasha at his side, and root for Daniel and Emily to make it while wondering what really happened two decades ago.  A final twist marks a strong Webb of deceit tale that showcases a fine author on her A-game.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
N Review based on a cursory examination by University of Phoenix students in Philosophy 251.  <br />We have found the book to be well organized, and detailed. The structure placed the information in an easy to read and presentable manner. <br />The use of strong and sound proofs by experiment and examples supported the overall logic of reasoning in a clear and concise manner. <br />We have found the book to be well thought out and laid out so the reader can learn and follow what is being explained. <br />
N My only complaint is that this book was a bit repetative, and Holden's vocabulary only consists of 4 words: sonuvabitch, goddamn, lousy and phony. It was still quite humorous and the actual story was interesting.<br /><br />It was easy to read and to relate to, so you should pick it up if you're looking for a fun read. Some people complain about the lack of a plot, but to understand this book you need to read deeper into it. It's actually a lot more than some annoying kid's list of complaints about life.<br /><br />The story is about Holden Caulfield's coming of age and realizing that growing up is not a process that can be stopped. He had a lousy childhood, as he puts it, and wants to save other children from going though the things he experienced in his life. He is telling the story from a mental institution, which he was placed in after returning home from the fourth Prep school he had been kicked out of. He flashes back to the events leading up to his arrival at his home and tells the story of those 3 days.

N Though she is honored to be Chicago Woman of the Year, Victoria Colby-Camp is more euphoric over the mental improvement that her son Jim has shown recently especially since he and Tasha North fell in love.  Jim was snatched almost twenty years ago when he was seven and turned into the killing Seth whose goal was to murder Victoria for abandoning him.  However, her elation would turn to despair if she knew Seth resurfaced and started to rape a pregnant Tasha.<br /><br />Former military strategist Daniel Marks is in town complements of the Colby Agency that wants to hire him.  Also in Chicago is Emily Hastings whose father a veteran homicide detective was murdered.  She finds letters linking her dad to Victoria, the woman's long ago murdered first husband James, and her dad's first partner Marelyn Rutland that confuses her.  Soon she will meet Daniel and they will be embroiled in the COLBY CONSPIRACY that goes back almost two decades ago.<br /><br />Though the subplots can become confusing at first, once the audience comprehends how this complex superb suspense thriller starts to come together, they will want more Colby Agency tales; (see FILES FROM THE COLBY AGENCY: THE BODYGUARD'S BABY PROTECTIVE CUSTODY).  The ensemble cast is solid as fans will feel with Victoria who has overcome so much tragedy, hope Jim \\"defeats\\" Seth with Tasha at his side, and root for Daniel and Emily to make it while wondering what really happened two decades ago.  A final twist marks a strong Webb of deceit tale that showcases a fine author on her A-game.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner

Y At last... a comprehensive visual compendium of the most celebrated artistic promotional film marketing campaign worldwide... almost.  You would think that the opulent Mr. Sansweet would have in his possession every single poster to have ever rolled off the printing press for this unprecedented franchise but several of my favorite foreign one-sheets, daybills, banners and bus stop posters are notably missing.  Does this mean that Mr. Sansweet has not aquired all of them in his envious collection of Star Wars memorabilia?  Not likely.  Chances are he has every single one of them... locked away somewhere within the bowels of his coveted archives.  Most notably absent is the lack of reference material specifically promoting Revenge of the Sith and would seem to indicate that this book was completed and ready to be published just prior to the film's theatrical exhibition, but there is a plethora of wonderful international promotional material such as the six character U.K. bus stop posters that are much more visually exciting than the disappointing U.S. domestic ad campaign that demands to be published.  This can only mean that another volume must be sure to follow.  Still, there are enough international poster variations out there to keep collectors like myself and presumably Mr. Sansweet himself scouring the farthest reaches of the globe and the galaxy for years to come.
N During the reign of Henry VIII, at fourteen Elizabeth Meredith inherited Friarsgate when her mother and older middle sister married and moved onto their respective spouses' estate and her oldest sibling and her husband chose the king's court.  Eight years later she remains independent running her estate until her mother informs her she must marry so that an heir can inherit Friarsgate.<br /><br />Her beloved sixty years old Uncle Thomas agrees to escort the feisty landowner to court.  However, before they leave for London, Baen MacColl comes from Scotland at the behest of his father to discus a sheep deal.  As the two die in the wool anti-marital soul mates fall in love, Elizabeth chaperoned by her uncle travels to the king's court.  There she befriends the beleaguered queen while Henry VIII begins his campaign to replace his wife Katherine with Anne.<br /><br />The key to this battle between two independent obstinate loving combatants is the background that incorporates Henry's antics as he sets in motion his plan to remove Katherine of Aragon as queen and replace her with Anne Boleyn.  Bertrice Small cleverly uses the monumental sixteenth century events to tell her story of love yet in some ways the shadow overwhelms the lead characters.  Fans of historical romance with strong doses of both will enjoy the latest Meredith tale (see UNTIL YOU AND PHILIPPA).<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
N This book isn't merely a primer for capitalist thinking, it is a Bible for free enterprise.  Everyone on the planet should read MILLIONAIRE REPUBLICAN, then utilize the implements provided.

MOVE OVER, AYN RAND.
N The Outlander series are my favorite books of all time, period.  But after reading the Fiery Cross, I was a bit let down, as many people were, and afraid that the rest of the series would just continue to go downhill.  So when A Breath of Snow and Ashes came out, I was so glad to see that it was getting good reviews.  I finally got to read it this week and was not disappointed in the least. <br />All the characters we know and love are back, and Brianna seems to have finally grow up.  She has been my least favorite character since the second book, but this time around she was actually likeable (for the most part).  At certain points this book became so intense that I actually had to put it down and take a break for awhile, but not all readers will have this experience, only ones that are practically obsessed with this series (and who's friends have to remind them, \\"Jamie is NOT a real person!).    <br />So basically, if you have read the previous books, just read this one. Please.  You won't regret it.  The only reason I didn't give this one five stars is that I think nothing can top Outlander and Dragonfly in Amber.  If I could give this 4.5, I would. <br /> <br />One thing I have wondered about - if Claire dies back in the 1700's, then she'll be born again in 1918, go back in time in 1946, die in the 1700's, be born in 1918, and just keep repeating this forever.  For all she knows this could be her tenth time doing this.  I haven't seen this matter dealt with in the books.  Did I just miss it or something?
Y This is a marvelous read, and those already familiar with the Abel Jones series will not be disappointed.  Again, I am amazed and appreciative of the amount of research that Mr. Parry puts into his novels, and this book is a prime example.  It is a wonderful story that not only entertains, but also enlightens about one of the most important eras in our history, and, one of the most important cities and cultures (New Orleans) in our country.  I couldn't put it down and read it all in one sitting.  Thank again to the author, and I look forward to reading about how the venerable Abel Jones will come to grips with his latest personal struggle regarding family over duty!
N The premise of the book is hilarious: Dick and Jane, all grown up and still living in suburbia. But this isn't the suburbia of Ward and June Cleaver. It's the suburbia of \\"Desperate Housewives\\" with a Yiddish twist.<br /><br />It made me nostalgic for my years living in Miami Beach. Oy ve, where did the years go? Even the goyim who didn't grow up hearing Yiddish will love this book.

N this boook was a great one that you could learn from. it not only teaches the imponrtance of family and their values but it also deals with basic issues that teens and some kids even deal with.  this book is about 4 best friends who are for the first time in their lives spending their summer apart. one day they are all in one of the girls rooms and finds a pair of pants that were tucked away in her closet.  once all four  of them try them on they realize that there is really something special about these pants.  seeming as how all 4 girls are differnt shapes and sizes and somehow the pants fit all of them,  they realize that these pants were the start of something special.  immediatley following they decided to make up certian rules abut the pants such as you must write the best thing u did while wearing the pants over your summer on the right leg and also some silly things such as to \\"never pick yuor nose while wearing the pants.\\"  this book follows the girls throuh their summers in differnt places of the world and through all of the different obstacles that life takes them through. it can really teach you alot not only about what is going on around you but most imporntantly about yuorself.  i would give this book 4 stars and would reccommend it to anyone who seems the slihgtest bit interested.
N If you are looking for something to stimulate your brain, this isn't it.  However, if you are just looking for a good laugh, you'll enjoy The Bad Girl's Guide.  It's funny and light, and definitely a good way to pass a little bit of time.

N Review based on a cursory examination by University of Phoenix students in Philosophy 251.  <br />We have found the book to be well organized, and detailed. The structure placed the information in an easy to read and presentable manner. <br />The use of strong and sound proofs by experiment and examples supported the overall logic of reasoning in a clear and concise manner. <br />We have found the book to be well thought out and laid out so the reader can learn and follow what is being explained. <br />
N My only complaint is that this book was a bit repetative, and Holden's vocabulary only consists of 4 words: sonuvabitch, goddamn, lousy and phony. It was still quite humorous and the actual story was interesting.<br /><br />It was easy to read and to relate to, so you should pick it up if you're looking for a fun read. Some people complain about the lack of a plot, but to understand this book you need to read deeper into it. It's actually a lot more than some annoying kid's list of complaints about life.<br /><br />The story is about Holden Caulfield's coming of age and realizing that growing up is not a process that can be stopped. He had a lousy childhood, as he puts it, and wants to save other children from going though the things he experienced in his life. He is telling the story from a mental institution, which he was placed in after returning home from the fourth Prep school he had been kicked out of. He flashes back to the events leading up to his arrival at his home and tells the story of those 3 days.
N This book is chilling and depressing indeed, though very well written and sprinkled with frequent humor.  I was sort of surprised however by the comment in Publisher's Weekly which said that \\"PW suspects that many of those buyers will be disappointed. Ehrenreich can't deliver the promised story because she never managed to get employed in the 'midlevel corporate world' she wanted to analyze.\\"  I never viewed that as being the \\"promised story\\" in the first place.  To me, the primary point of the book was to describe what it was like to actually try to ENTER that world in the first place rather than describing what life was like when she got there--and that she did.  In fact, I actually thought that she \\"lucked out\\" in a sense by having the bizarre, surreal experiences she did--not only did it make for more entertaining and more thought-provoking reading, but in my mind, if she HAD obtained a job right away, it would have taken away the whole raison d'etre of the book.  It would have been a completely different book in which she merely described her (presumably) boring mid-level corporate job, which probably would have been the same from day to day.  Thus, at least for purposes of writing the book, I think she was \\"lucky\\" that things worked out the way they did.  As for the reader who criticized her for not taking the \\"jobs\\" offered by AFLAC and Mary Kay, I thought those comments were bizarre.  I agree with Ms. Ehrenreich's point in that \\"jobs\\" such as these in which the employer offers no salary, no benefits, no office, no help and essentially takes no risk whatsoever can hardly be considered jobs in the traditional sense she was seeking.  In any event, it's really a pretty scary and depressing book, but one which I recommend.
N When looking for &lt;a href=\\"[...]\\">lock picking books&lt;/a>, this one is very informative. It will give one great ideas on opening padlocks, but the language is very basic, no frills here.

There are however, some caveats for the reader. The book needs to be contextualized within a larger conceptual framework. The overarching issues are ignored within her practical framework, namely: Who needs to change? Who needs to accommodate whom?  How much? What are the risks and benefits? Her book appears to be saying that corporate America needs to understand Asians, but it does not need to change.  Rather it is the Asian professional that needs to change and adapt. <br /> <br />Is the book too heavily assimilationist?  It is not clear as Hyun does make a distinction early in her book between assimilation (\\"adopting ...at the expense of one's own cultural characteristics\\") and acculturation (\\"adapting ...while continuing to maintain values, perspectives, and features of one's native culture\\"). <br /> <br />There appears to be little adaptation of any Asian models or perspective to the mainstream USA corporate culture -- page 279 suggests two ways: \\"Develop cultural competency\\" and \\"Make use of your bicultural and bilingual abilities.\\" While recognizing the dominance of USA/Western research and models in the business world, it is also logical and no \\"one model fits all.\\" Perhaps future research and practices can provide indigenous Asian models or perspectives that can be adapted and work effectively in coporate America or other cultures.  The Special Issue on China & India (Business Week, August 22/29, 2005) points out how some USA business models are not applicable. <br /> <br />It is not an either/or proposition.  By utilizing the juxtaposition of the Asian behavior/values system versus the Western behavior/values system to present her central thesis, Hyun creates a false dichotomy in the mind of the reader. Current business literature is filled with exhortations of \\"win/win,\\" \\"both/and,\\" \\"alignment,\\" and \\"interdependence\\" -- all very Asian concepts. These traditional Asian cultural values are at the very heart of what contemporary corporate America is trying to effect in order to add value. So there is a \\"baby with the bath water\\" caveat here to the reader.  The accommodation needs to be reciprocal, not unilateral. <br /> <br />In her Epilogue, Hyun encourages the reader to \\"Develop an Action Plan That Works with Your Persona.\\"  It seems throughout her book that the emphasis is on asking the reader to tailor his or her persona to that which is required for success in corporate America, not on utilizing the behavioral strengths and cognitive positions with which someone who comes with a strong Asian cultural background is imbued.  Being Asian -- it seems to Hyun -- puts one in a deficit position. <br /> <br />The reader needs to be cautious in the self-assessment, individual profiles, exercises and tools cited. They yield helpful descriptive self-awareness profiles and information, not diagnostic or predictive profiles, and they are dependent on situational factors.

US	34103525	R2IUKLDR8YOU3B	0674011929	707555499	Nero	Books	4	17	17	N	Y	The man, the monster, the legend.	Champlin bravely asserts his own contribution to the great wealth of Neronian scholarship for the critics to pick apart. I find very little to quibble about.<br />It is difficult to write even-handedly about Nero for a Western audience. Who could forget the image of a man who \\"fiddled while Rome burned\\" or the terrible tyrant who had begun a nearly 170 year \\"persecution\\" of the early Christians, under whose reign both Peter and Paul were executed? As other reviewer comments reveal, you can easily earn the brand of a Nero \\"apologist\\" if you don't tow the party line, however inaccurate it might be.<br /><br />Champlin's thesis can be stated simply as follows: many, if not most of Nero's grandstands and outrageous actions, were performed out of considerable political shrewdness and calculation - not the madness or puerile excess wrongly attributed to a \\"live fast, die young, and leave a good looking corpse\\" emperor. Nero's success, Champlin argues in the first chapter, is evinced by a shockingly prolonged \\"afterlife\\" manifested in pseudo-Neros, Judeo-Christian apocalyptic writings, and a disenfranchised populace openly lamenting his death. Nonetheless, I cannot help but wonder, (working on the same assumption,) whether he had truly orchestrated his public relations as well as Champlin suggests given his untimely demise at age 30.<br /><br />Some reviewers disagree, but I reckon Champlin's original Nero-Periander link to be one of the most intriguing ideas in ancient biography I've ever seen. The ambivalent relationship with the mother, the Philhellenism, the artistic bent, and the numerous other links are too compelling to ignore outright, even if the conclusion a hard sell. Further research is warranted, but I suspect that Champlin, with his great intellect and energy, may have already exhausted all of the available evidence for advancing his thesis. He demonstrates the Augustus/Antony connections thoroughly. The discussion of the great fire of 64 is arrestingly well done: after convincingly presenting the defense for Nero's innocence, he suddenly shatters the deception in stating that despite this preceding evidence, Nero undoubtedly held direct responsibility for the coflagration. It hits you with dramatic effect almost equal to one of the primary sources comprising the centerpiece of his proof in this sudden reversal: Tacitus' Annales XV.67.<br /><br />Champlin's organization is somewhat bothersome as it is in \\"Final Judgments,\\" because he rejects chronological arrangement for thematic foci. This requires repetition of several facts, and I cannot understand his reasons for the chapter order. The post-mortem legacy of Nero, being most fascinating, he puts up front obviously to hook his reader. It serves as an interesting set piece for further discourse, because the inevitable wonder we feel about Nero's impression on the world ever after demands explanation: thus the rest of the book. But with Dio, Suetonius, and Tacitus unfolding the bulk of their own histories so methodically, the rearrangement isn't always a neat fit. Still, Champlin's brilliant weaving together of hundreds of sources, as before, vindicates his literary decisions several times over.<br /><br />Champlin, like any other historian, has his hypotheses and directs his evidence toward proving them. His presentation however, is replete with past scholarship and primary sources presented candidly and fairly. One of the most appreciable inclusions is the extensive collection of Latin graffiti, which add a critical dimension to our knowledge. This book has been for me an introduction into full-strength Neronian scholarship and I found it both accessible and empowering enough to read further with confidence.ngly presenting the defense for Nero's innocence, he suddenly shatters the deception in stating that despite this preceding evidence, Nero undoubtedly held direct responsibility for the coflagration.

They kill their prey when they feed, so for me they have no redeeming graces no matter how polite, handsome, sexy, etc that they are.  I really did not want to read more than the first few pages, but since I spent so much money on this very short novella, I thought I could probably stand to finish it.  I found the writing less than spectacular also.  The descriptions and scenes seemed to be written in an amateur fashion, so I could not think of the characters as \\"real.\\"  The two main characters fell in love so quickly that I had to read the page again to be sure I had gotten it correct.  Nia was ready for Seth to make a move on her before he even came in the door.  Others may like this sort of approach, but I need some buildup for the relationship to ring true.  While I did like the mixed race content, the rest of it left me cold.  Killer vampires are just not my cup of tea and I could care less if they meet their mates and live happily ever after.  Just think of how many people over the centuries had their lives cut short so that these vampires could continue their existence. Even Nia's friend Imani is killed in the first three pages of the story.  What more can I say.	2005-10-14

For example, the human mind is excellent at recognizing patterns in things...to such a degree that we find many patterns in things which are actually random.  Another bias is the basic tendency to be accepting of evidence which is consistent with our belief but subjecting contradictory evidence to more careful scrutiny.  I have heard the explanation that chronic gamblers tend to relive their wins and block out their losses.  In actual fact, they dwell on the losses a lot more than the wins.  If so, why do they continue not only to gamble, but believe that they are better at it than they really are?  The answer is that their wins are almost always viewed as due to talent and many of the losses are re-categorized as \\"near wins.\\" (\\"If not for that field goal in the last seconds of the game, I would have won\\"--much more so than the corresponding \\"I almost lost that one, but they kicked a field goal at the end of the game and saved it for me.\\")  The first 125 pages cover six different types of bias (and variations of them). <br /> <br />The last third of the book analyzes three cases (alternative medicine, social interaction strategies, & ESP) where there is a lot of belief which is not supported by evidence.  These help a lot in making the ideas from the first part more concrete.	2005-10-14

As a physician and early American history buff I was really looking forward to learning more about Benjamin Rush.<br /><br />In general it seems that the author, despite putting out what appears to be a finished, presentable biography, never really dug into source materials to find out who Benjamin Rush was and why he was important.  Repeatedly, we hear of Rush's fame and accomplishments and influence, but the details are missing.<br /><br />We hear what a great doctor Rush was, considered the preeminent physician of his times, according to the author, but all the author writes about is how Rush tortured his patients with medical treatments we now know are harmful, such as bloodletting, giving cathartics, etc.  Rush is known as the \\"Father of American Psychiatry\\", his book on psychiatry was bible for many many years, and his observations on mental illness were in many ways way way ahead of his times...yet not a word of this is mentioned except in the last ten pages of this 365 page book.  This subject desperately needed to explained.  This is why he is important for heaven's sake.<br /><br />Furthermore, I think it would have been fascinating to have gotten a better feel for what bloodletting and giving cathartics was about, we needed some good old source material, firsthand observations and then-current thoughts, as well as an expose of the tools employed, etc.  Rush, it is clear, considered himself first and foremost and physician.  He dedicated his life to the practice of medicine, he was considered a top academic lecturer.  We are told all the top American physicians for the next half century were either disciples of Rush or disciples of his students.....but we don't really get a feeling for why.<br /><br />His political contributions and inolvement were similarly neglected.  Although he wasn't the political calibre of Hamilton or Jefferson, he was definitely a major player.  Much of the earlier portion of the biography seemed to focus on explaining the political events occurring around Rush during the fight for independence.  The focus should have been Rush.  There's a lot of negativity surrounding Rush early on in the book, but how he seems to know all the important figures in the Revolution and why they respect him is not explained.<br /><br />There also weren't any pictures or illustrations.  I could go on.  On the bright side, at least the book reads well.  If you want to learn more about Rush, you should probably choose another book.  Sorry.	2005-10-14

This book is a must-read for anyone who wants to grow spiritually, who wants to live a conscious and compassionate life, and who wants to contribute to world peace. I have read many books on the topic of vegetarianism, animal rights and animal welfare,  spiritual growth, and peace and nonviolence. This book stands alone in its ability to make the connection between all of these subjects. <br /> <br />Will Tuttle, Ph.D. is a rare combination of extraordinary compassion, scholarly research and education, spiritual commitment and wisdom, intuitive insights, and the courage to challenge a worldview which goes back 10,000 years <br />  <br />In this book, Tuttle explores humanity's relationship with the foods we eat.  He points out, very convincingly, that when humans began herding animals, it began to create a consciousness of exploitation which then spread to the control and domination of other humans, as well as animals.  So the roots of human's violence to humans are found in the practice of seeing animals as objects to exploit for our own purposes: for food, furs, labor, entertainment, \\"sport\\" and experimentation. The use of humans as slaves and the subjugation of women followed the subjugation and enslavement of animals. <br /> <br />One thing that sets this book apart from any of the others that describe the problems associated with a meat-based diet is the focus on the spiritual aspects of our diet.  When we take food into our bodies, we are also ingesting the energy contained in this food. Animals that are tortured and filled with terror and agony as they are killed are filled with this very negative energy.  When humans eat their flesh, we are also ingesting this fear and anger. This affects us deeply.  We cannot live with peace in our hearts as long as we are filling our bodies with the pain and suffering of other beings. <br />   <br />Tuttle helps us to see that none of us have actually chosen a diet based upon meat. Our mothers fed us meat from our infancy.As we got old enough to understand that we were eating animals, we were told that animals were put here for us to eat, so it was okay.  We didn't question this, any more than we questioned wearing clothes or taking baths. Thus, we absorbed the acceptance of exploitation of animals so naturally that we didn't know it was happening.  And being unconscious, it is hard to recognize the violence that is part of our everyday lives through the eating of animals.  Therefore, it is also hard to recognize how insensitive we have become to violence, because we have to protect ourselves from an awareness of the violence we are part of 3 times a day.   <br />  <br />This is a very important book for everyone who wants their lives to contribute to more peace in the world, rather than more suffering and violence.  <br />  <br />	2005-10-14

He could be considered a living national treasure, and I feel fortunate to be alive as his contemporary.  His body of work is enormous, his influence immeasurable; his importance cannot be overstated. <br /> <br />Don't be put off by the copyright date of this book, which is 1971 (despite what the information states, this is probably a third edition of the book, but I believe all three editions are identical aside from the cover).  The material is relevent and perennial.  Historical Japan has not changed, and Keene's insights are every bit as valid now as they were when they were set down on paper (most of the material in this book actually predates the 1971 copyright).  The suggested reading list at the back of the book is a superb springboard for further study, should a certain topic particularly amuse the reader, and the listed volumes are also excellent and continue to be highly relevent. <br /> <br />While a new edition is well-purchased at $22, an older edition can be had cheaply.  I personally own the second edition and am quite pleased with it.  I actually find myself here looking for a hardbound version, but, as one does not exist, I must make do with asserting my heartfelt opinion for this volume. <br /> <br />Basically amounting to an Anthology of Keene of sorts, a collection of some of his writings on Japan, it's an invaluable text.  Were I to teach a general class in Japanese culture, this would surely be a book to include; perhaps it would be the only book necessary.  Infinitely readable, inspirational, interesting, and difficult to put down, I couldn't recommend it more highly.   <br /> <br />If my contributions to the study of Japan and the bridging of cultures amount to even a percentage of Keene's, my life will have been quite a productive one. <br /> <br />Another option to pursue is another collection of Keene's writings called, \\"The Blue-Eyed Taroukaja,\\" and its copyright is much more recent.  It's also highly recommended alongside this one.	2005-10-14

US	52118148	R2ZWUHBLJGPTX9	0465046754	692787574	The Republican War on Science	Books	5	51	61	N	Y	Read this book to understand how far we have descended	In the middle of the 2004 presidential election campaign a report released by the Union of Concerned Scientists, endorsed by thousands of respected academics, accused the Bush administration of an unprecedented pattern of distortion and censorship of important scientific evidence. In typical fashion, the administration responded only when the UCS report gained media attention, and then only to dismiss it as a partisan attack from the left. <br /> <br />Chris Mooney's book documents in plain and incontrovertible fashion why the UCS report was not only non-partisan truth, but significantly understated the case. The current political abuse of science is only the culmination of a consistent strategy fostered by a \\"hard right\\" alliance of corporate and religious conservatives that has gained control of the Republican party since the 1960's. <br /> <br />Corporate attacks on science started with tobacco industry efforts to undermine studies on the health effects of smoking and second-hand smoke. The pattern laid down by the tobacco industry has been consistently followed since: the terms \\"sound science\\" and \\"junk science\\", meaningless in any scientific sense, originated with tobacco lawsuits and have been parlayed by conservatives into codewords for science that respectively supports or threatens \\"conservative\\" ideology. <br /> <br />Mooney categorizes the attacks on science as falling into two main categories. The first of these is an undermining of the processes of science by suppression of information, targeting individual scientists (many of whom work for the government or rely on government grants), or rigging review and advisory committees. The second form these right-wing attacks take is through the communication process to the public after reports are released. This includes \\"spinning\\" the science through misrepresentations or distortions, magnifying uncertainty, relying on and promoting fringe scientists and \\"contrarians\\", and putting scientific clothing on \\"values\\" and ideology. <br /> <br />\\"Manufacturing uncertainty\\" was a key to the tobacco industry strategy that has been repeated again and again on issues from global warming to evolution.  Finding a token scientist to magnify \\"contrarian\\" claims isn't hard: science's health comes from the weathering of constant attacks by those who choose to think differently. But sadly there are also too many scientists willing to distort their own research to conform to the ideologies of funding sources, and a disturbing number of government scientists working for regulatory agencies have been encouraged to alter conclusions of their reports. Mooney notes the sharp distinction in conclusions on the effects of second-hand smoke between industry-funded and independent scientists. <br /> <br />It is one thing to argue and make political decisions based on all the best facts available. That's what we expect our leaders to do. But the right wing attack on science is not satisifed with the facts as they are on the environemnt, biology or medicine. Rather they seek to distort those facts, imposing ideology at an earlier stage, so that decision makers and the public don't even have the truth available to them to make good decisions. <br /> <br />Many of the \\"contrarian\\" scientists who have been selected by the Bush administration to sit on major oversight and advisory panels have very little research background at all. Unfortunately, science's ivory tower makes it far too easy to \\"play scientist\\" for the public - there are no external credentialing mechanisms that effectively separate real experts from impostors. Tellingly, for these political hacks the arguments change with time as the facts on the ground become increasingly inconvenient to their ideology. Denial of global warming becomes denial of human causation, now morphing into assertion that global warming will be good for us. Creationism becomes \\"intelligent design\\". <br /> <br />The broad range of regulatory and scientific areas where the same anti-science tactics have been used forces the conclusion that this is more than separate isolated incidents. Similar issues with failed intelligence on 9-11 and Iraq's WMD, and other apparent efforts to conceal the facts on the ground by the administration imply this pattern of ideological decision making extends far beyond  the areas where science is the central source of facts. <br /> <br />There are examples of liberal science abuse too, where individuals are tempted to spin the facts to fit their ideology. Mooney cites a few cases, but the only systematic pattern seems to be one of exaggeration of direct effects and perhaps denial of uncertainty. Of the examples in question, almost all show liberal statements to be much closer to the scientific facts than the right-wing spin on the same issues. Even so, neither side should try to twist science to their benefit, and to his credit Mooney does criticize both. <br /> <br />The book has a few flaws: there are occasional jarring repetitions of previous arguments that suggest chapters were rewritten several times in mid-stream, without reconsidering the book as a whole. Mooney also seems reluctant to state as baldly as possible what's going on here: some people are lying about the facts, and as a result, other people are dying needlessly. Isn't there legal recourse for such fraud, as happened in the case of tobacco? <br /> <br />Mooney makes a number of sensible suggestions beyond legal action: reinstate the congressional Office of Technology Assessment, pass legislation to bar political litmus tests for committees, roll back the \\"sound science\\" regulatory reform that has done so much harm. More skepticism and understanding of the processes of science from journalists would be a big help, as would some reforms in the science community itself.  But as he also points out, significant change will be impossible in our democracy as long as the current ideologues hold all the strings of power. Getting the information out somehow and persuading the public to vote for moderates instead of ideologues is the most important thing we can do - will it be enough?	2005-10-14

I had to suspend my contact with reality a little bit, but I truly enjoyed this book on CD.  There was one incredible mistake, however, from Ellie, the supposed art expert.  She made the comment that she could \\"shoot John the Baptist through the eye in the painting of the Last Supper.\\"  As any good art expert (or Roman Catholic) would know, St. John the Baptist was not in Da Vinci's Last Supper; he was executed before Jesus even began his public ministry. <br /> <br />Despite this glaring error, Patterson had many twists and turns that kept me listening to this CD.  Just when I thought I had the whole story figured out, the plot twisted just enough to throw me off.  The ending was somewhat contrived and unbelievable; it also seemed rushed compared to the rest of this novel.  Overall, however, I would recommend it.	2005-10-14

This is actually too soon for this review to be written -- I've only been pursuing the stretches (exercises) for a little over a month now.<br /><br />  On the plus side, I believe I can credit this book with helping me get through the last week or so -- in addition to a cold, I ended up dealing with back, leg, and shoulder problems after a day of tree cutting and trimming, another day of construction work on the house, and a third day of helping our grown children prepare their pool for winter storage, which included letting cold water run over my feet for two hours.  I've suffered from short hamstrings for most of my life, a condition that was finally diagnosed just last year, and any one of those days (besides the cold) would have previously put me in bed for at least a day.  The combination should have put me in hospital for at least four days.  Not to say that I didn't have problems, but thanks in part to techniques and stretches from Mr. Cooley's book, I managed to stay active and motile, and have now almost fully recovered.<br /><br />  To the negative, it could be that Mr. Cooley puts too much stock in his own discoveries, and he is certainly too used to working with people with already-developed athletic capabilities.<br /><br />  First, \\"too much stock in his own discoveries.\\"  The first section of the book describes how Bob Cooley survived a near-death experience, and how he came upon his stretching techniques while recovering for that experience.  I have not yet walked his path long enough to deliver a real judgement, but I suspect that part of the benefits he ascribes to his techniques is actually a normal part of his return trip from death's door.<br /><br />  This is not to say that there is no value in his stretching techniques, but rather that they may not be the \\"univeral fix-everything\\" he represents them to be.<br /><br />  The second negative is that I find his presentation better suited to those who are already developed athletically rather than the majority of us who are somewhat motion impared.  By his own statement, Mr. Cooley discovered his first stretching techniques while attempting a middling-advanced yoga position. His book also includes testimonies from several world-class athletes, which I certainly would not dispute.  However, I had to invent several \\"remedial\\" stretches before even attempting the beginning series of stretches presented in his book (fortunately I have some theraputic streching and hatha yoga in my background), and a few of the illustrations for the beginning stretches seem misleading if not plain wrong.  The intermediate and advanced series appear to be correct, as far as I can currently tell.<br /><br />  Mr. Cooley's basic premise is that first, streching is good and second, stretching against resistance is better.  Theroretically this makes sense, since then all the cells in a muscle would elongate rather than just those involved at the muscle's maximum extension.  Also, \\"resistence stretching\\" is very similar to what most of us do naturally just before or after arising from bed.  However, as noted in the book, the \\"immediate strength\\" of a muscle will decline if only his stretching techniques are used.  Again this makes sense -- from my observation, the existing strength of a muscle becomes \\"spread\\" over the entire range of motion for that muscle, and as the muscle cells and fibers elongate, the \\"new\\" portion of them is weak until strengthened through other forms of exercise.  In fairness, the book points out that the stretches can be turned into strength building exercises by reversing their direction, but the follow-through on this concept is weak.<br /><br />  I don't feel qualified to comment on whether his claimed connection between his exercise cycles and the \\"meridians\\" of traditional Chinese medicine is valid.  I do know that, while many of his positions approximate those of hatha yoga, the muscle groups involved don't necessarily correspond -- for example, the \\"child\\" position in both yoga and western rehabilitation therapy focuses on the lower back and Mr. Cooley uses it to stretch the upper back, shoulders and arms.  Not necessarily wrong, mind you, but a much different emphasis.  Also, the beginning series doesn't quite involve ALL of the muscle groups, at least as I understand them.<br /><br />  In summary:  The book's main feature is \\"resistance stretching\\" (which might also be described as isometrics in motion).  While not the universal panacea it's presented to be, the concept IS quite useful and beneficial. It should be used in addition to other exercise techniques, not as a replacement for them, and Mr. Cooley would do well to include a set of remedial \\"absolute beginner\\" stretches for the less athletic among us.  Meanwhile, I'm glad I got the book, and I intend to keep doing the stretches.	2005-10-14

In five well-balanced chapters, the author opens up the important question about the extent to which the prophet Isaiah-and thus the book that bears his name-was influenced by the strain of Israelite reflection that scholars call 'wisdom'. In setting forth his apology and objectives, Whedbee recognizes the danger of explaining the prophets systematically based upon a narrow selection of texts. For some time, scholars drove a deep wedge between the 'prophet's word' and the 'sage's counsel'.<br /><br />A number of changes in the prevailing scholarly winds have made a study like Whedbee's possible. The sage is now viewed more positively as a guardian of communal integrity than was the case in a previous generation. Also the complex-rather than simple-relationship between traditional wisdom and the prophetic task has become more evident. Whedbee proposes to sort out traditional versus technical wisdom as it appears in Isaiah, presuming that the latter emerges out of the former. Also, he anticipates showing his reader how Isaiah processes and adapts wisdom traditions as he inherits and employs them.<br /><br />Having sketched out a refreshingly loose-fitting-not to say baggy-profile for wisdom and its origins, forms, and intentionalities, Whedbee approaches the formal matter of 'Parables, Proverbs, and Related Gattungen' in an extensive chapter two (pp. 23-79). Methodologically, he cautions against assuming the presence of wisdom influence on Isaiah wherever there is overlap with wisdom terminology. Rather, he seeks distinctive (parabolic) content for the basis of his study. Whedbee is attentive to the 'heterogonous' nature of Isaiah's argumentation, a perspective that allows him to evade the analytical trap of absolutizing genres and then dissecting speeches in order to assign each element to a distinct classification. Isaiah, Whedbee says, is 'free' to use a large number of figures of speech, some of which take a sapiential tack, because the disjunction between prophetic word and creation's witness is a modern rather than an ancient one. For the prophet, the two would have enjoyed an essential unity.<br /><br />In his third chapter ('Woe Oracles and Wisdom', pp. 80-110), Whedbee argues for a close relationship between the Hebrew Bible's 'woe' oracles and the 'ashrey' ('blessed is ...') statements. He approves Gerstenberger's discernment of a strong concern for social justice in both kinds of affirmations, provisionally accepting as well Gerstenberger's theory that the statements derive from popular wisdom settings. After surveying some of the distinctly Isaianic 'woes', Whedbee concludes that both law and wisdom emerge from a common source and thus it is not wise to distinguish too sharply between their respective influence as traditionary sources for Isaiah. Nevertheless, it would be equally unwise to overlook the instructional/sapiential nature of Isaiah's utilization of the tradition.<br /><br />In 'Counsel/Counsellor and Jerusalem Court Wisdom' (ch. four, pp. 111-148), Whedbee argues for a non-secular (in the technical sense) view of professional wisdom circles in biblical Israel and Judah. That is, these circles had their own view of the divine source of counsel and wisdom and their own tradition regarding the inherent limitations of human wisdom. Isaiah's criticism of the sages of his day used their own language ('etsah) and was not uniquely prophetic. Though he criticizes the counsellors of his day, his vision for the future includes wise counsellors, indeed a messianic figure that is cast in part in the figure of just such a counsellor. In contrast to the policies supported by the court counsellors of his day-some of which Isaiah found inimical to Yahwistic faith-the prophet rests in the divine 'counsel' which is not only inscrutable but also trustworthy in its intentions for Israel/Judah.<br /><br />A conclusion (pp. 149-153) neatly restates the outline of an argument that is both cogent and well-presented in the core ofthe book. In the thirty-four years since its publication, Whedbee's work has been criticized but in general has stood its ground admirably. Scholarship regarding the interplay between wisdom, prophecy, and law has been marked by this important work, which now finds itself somewhat in the main stream.e its publication, Whedbee's work has been criticized but in general has stood its ground admirably.

With each new edition that has arrived since the game's conception back in 1989, a new set of rules, more stream lined, more focused on fun rather than rule mongering, has arisen. Shadowrun 4th edition is the biggest rule change yet.<br /><br />Vet's to the game who enjoyed the game for it's rule's, not it's gaming world, have voiced their distaste for the game. I myself was very skeptical of these completely new rules. Let me clarify now, this game has indeed evolved, and these new rules are a step in the right direction. Players of games like Vampire: the Masquarde/the Requiem, Werewolf: the Apocalypse/the Forsaken, and other World of Darkness 1.0 and 2.0 games wil find these rules a bit familiar and comforting.<br /><br />Dice tests are no long single skills with the hopeful adding of a combat or specialty dice pool. Instead, tests are made combining attributes and skills into a combined pool, and all tests aim for the same Target Number \\"Hit\\" of 5. Modifiers just add or take away dice now, and the rule of one has been completly reworked.<br /><br />Thus, all vets to the game line will have to learn a whole new set of rules if htey want to stay alive in the shadows, but that's something they should be used to, adaptation.<br /><br />New Gamers will find these new rule sets much easier to approach than the older sets. While it feels like character creation is more complicated (which is something shadowrun has been known for), gameplay is smoother, the game suffers less from the same old \\"specialty classes getting so much alone time while they do their thing and everyone else gets a big break\\". Instead, with augmented realty (a trend most sci fi groups seem to be taking these days in Cyberpunk games and stories), groups find their Matrix has joined them in the real world.<br /><br />The reason this game loses a star is because there is a standard warning of skepticism. Vets should be warned of the issues with the changed rules. If you loved the rules system and not the game, this isn't an edition you want to pick up. If you want to adapt, and learn a more stream lined system, pick this book up, or go buy the PDF eBook and debate if it's worth your money to buy the physical book follow up.icism.

As someone completely new to aviation, there is so much jargon and unfamiliar equipment and so many acronyms and that the potential for looking stupid seems high. I didn't know what a pitot tube is, and I appreciate the fact that Rod Machado doesn't assume that the reader knows that or even that they know how to pronounce it. He says, \\"that' pee-toe, not pilot\\" which is helpful. If you've hung around airports for the past ten years, you probably already knew how to pronounce it, but I didn't. This excellent attention to detail is this books strength. The author gives not one, but two photographs of pitot tube and explains that they are usually found under the left wing. As another example, I had read elsewhere that you need to test your fuel for water, but a single glance at the two photographs he included turned the concept from some vague ethereal haze in the back of my mind to a simple, \\"Okay. I get it.\\" You can see this here on Amazon by clicking the \\"Look inside this book\\" link under the photograph of the book, then go forward a couple of pages to page A3. Figure 7 at the bottom of the page has the caption: \\"Under the wing is a fuel tank sump drain. Since airplane engines don't seem to run very well on impurities, the sumps should be drained before every flight and after every fueling.\\" Figure 8 next to it shows someone checking for impurities witha clear plastic fuel strainer. Nothing beats seeing it. <br /> <br />What I don't like about this book (and the reason I only gave it four stars) are the dumb jokes. When I read about the silly humor in another review I thought, \\"Lighten up, how bad can it really be?\\" Bad. Worse than you think. In fact, I think it detracts from an otherwise excellent book. What exactly does the author mean in the example above when he says, \\"Since airplane engines don't seem to run very well on impurities...\\"? Apparently, it's a joke (yuk, yuk). Besides from being distracting, it seems like what we get is a joke instead of information: what kind of impurities are we talking about here? Water? Or something else? These jokes are peppered throughout the text and they very quickly become tedious. I wish they were in the margin or in a different font so that I could ignore them. On page A5 the author talks about strobe lights on planes. One sentence starts, \\"This is necessary because...\\" I thought to myself, this must be an important point I'd better remember it. Disappointingly, the sentence ends with \\"...because screaming out the window does not work.\\" If these silly jokes were in a special font I could have more easily skipped over them and they would have been less irritating. <br /> <br />This is a large (as big as a medium size phone book), thorough and very well illustrated book and I'm glad I bought it.	2005-10-14

However, I counted at least three errors in the book.  Early in the book President Theodore Roosevelt is listed as being from the Harvard Class of 1880.  Several pages later he's listed as the class of 1895.  (1880 is the correct date...)  In discussions of Frank Hinkey, he is mentioned as one of only 5 four-time All Americans.  In the photo section, his picture is accompanied by a description that says he is one of 11 four-time All Americans.  Then, there is discussion of Ivy League football dropping from Division I-A to I-AA.  At first this is mentioned as having happened in 1982.  Later in the book, the 1974 Yale team is noted to have the best defense in Division I-AA.  (But they were still in Division I-A in '74, weren't they?)  <br /> <br />Anyway, these were three glaring errors that I picked up without doing any research or fact-checking.

The reason being that when I'm left to my own musings I'm just not a linier thinker. It's not that I go in all different directions. It's that the road to my destination goes serpentine. I'm distracted with thoughts that apply on the fringe and so I'd certainly want to stop and describe where my brain is meandering. That's exactly what Klosterman does here. <br />I do not have author Klosterman's excuse for such mental behavior as I am not a recreational drug user. If this writing technique of ours is actually one that readers appreciate then I should be grateful to my mother for allowing me to skip the inevitable depression that comes of drug and alcohol abuse (and in giving me a timely advantage) by dropping me on my head as a child. I don't actually remember being dropped on my head, but given the unexplained upper forehead scar, my non-drug addled brain, and yet having a Klosterman-esque propensity to mentally wander, I expect she did. <br />Now I must add a, \\"buyer beware!\\" One would normally expect that if an author takes a roundabout course to get where he's going, and if he has a lot to say about his actual topic, then you're going to have a fairly lengthy read. This book is a tiny read. It follows then that Klosterman doesn't end up writing very many pages on topic; that is if his topic is suppose to be dead rock stars.  <br />I bought the book because I wanted to read about dead rock stars and I wanted to be entertained by Klosterman's wit.

Connelly includes many twists and turns that actually make sense when you see the bigger picture.  My experience with mysteries is that sometimes the author tries to throw you off by twisting the plot so much that it loses its shape.  Not so in this book.

I was captivated by \\"White Teeth\\"'s sometime caricature-ish portrayal of the culturally and ethnically diverse cast of characters:  some of them take themselves too seriously, some of them don't think much of themselves or of their surroundings, but in the author made even the most self-conscious characters be a little self-deprecating in a humorous way.  Details are thrown at the reader either purposefully and effectively, or in a way that adds more color to the writing.  Upon reading the book, I felt that it's alright to take one's self seriously, and it's alright if one doesn't, but that we should both respect and take some humor in our diversity.  In \\"White Teeth\\" I felt that the author used diversity as a very good tool to make captivate the reader's interest, propel the story along, introduce conflict, and introduce humor all at the same time. <br /> <br />In \\"On Beauty\\", there is still that sprinkling of ethnic and cultural details, strong and minute, but they are more often neither necessary nor effective.  It seems that taking all the ethnic, gender, and cultural aspects from this novel will not subtract much from it.  The wit is still there, the cartoonish portrayals of certain archetypes and stereotypes are still there, but they are disconnected from the storyline.  I have not read the original inspiration of this story, so perhaps I am missing something here, but if I hadn't read \\"White Teeth\\" I will still have written the same about \\"On Beauty\\". <br /> <br />If you have read \\"White Teeth\\" and really enjoyed it, then \\"On Beauty\\" is worth the price of admission.  If you have not read \\"White Teeth\\" and know Zadie Smith only from book reviews and interviews, I will only hesitatingly recommend this book.  Perhaps it is Smith's familiarity with the British way of life that makes \\"White Teeth\\" appear to be a moreintegral and effortless piece of writing, but both aspects are lacking in this latest novel.	2005-10-13

Her life is overflowing with one thing after another.  She is a greeting card artist, is working on owning her own Greeting Card store, is dealing with a group of off kilter frinds (very, loyal friends), a brother in a mental hospital and an uncle who maybe should be.  Throw into this that she is part of a dating project in which she has to date 40 men in 60 days.  She has plenty to do. <br /> <br />While on a late night visit to the mental hospital to take her brother aluminum foil (read the book to find out why :)), she first sees a dead body on the way to the hospital lying in the road.  Since she fears that her brother has knowledge of it, or may have something to do with it, she takes no immediate action.  While at the hospital, she is taken somewhat hostage by a man pretending to be a doctor who is actually running from the mob, and has some knowledge of why the guy is dead in the road.   <br /> <br />What follows is a completely amusing and engrossing tale of how this all works out in a really fresh new way of doing so.  I found certain elements just a little far fetched (can't tell you what they are without giving something important away), I still found it a very good read and am currently reading the second in the series. <br /> <br />I found Wollie to be a fun herione with a lot of very real elements about her.  You can't help but like her and look forward to what she might do next.   <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book.  I did recognize that the author was an actress and do know who she is.  I don't see why some have made that an issue.  I think her work as an author and as an actress stand alone and speak for themselves.  I recommend her both as an author and an actress.	2005-10-13

The exercises outlined in this book, which I learned in conjunction with physical therapists associated with the New York University medical center, have been immensely helpful in preventing on-going pain and any severe reoccurrence.   <br /> <br />Of course, you should do these exercises only with the consultation of a doctor and/or physical therapist, especially if you have acute back pain caused by a protruding or ruptured disc. Also, of course, you should combine them (eventually) with a program to strengthen and stretch your muscles.  But, as many of you know, with back pain it can be very difficult to do these other exercises until you have found fundamental relief to the underlying causes of the pain, and these exercises, properly applied and for the right cases, can accomplish this. <br /> <br />The limited amount of time they take (litereally a couple of minutes) make these exercises very easy to maintain over time. <br /> <br />Robin McKenzie has been acknowledged around the world for his work with back pain.  His credentials are strong.  If you have found many other books to be generic and not that helpful, this one is different.  If the \\"popularizer\\" title puts you off, or if you are wanting a more in-depth anlaysis-- even if only to reassure yourself of the legitamacy of the medicine behind the exercises-- you can buy and read the formal textbooks he has written. <br /> <br />Good luck!	2005-10-13

I'm learning to speak Italian on my free time and i thought that since i read the Bible anyway, why not learn Italian and read my Bible at the same time?  There's a couple of issues i have though, the Italian used in this Bible is sort of an old Italian language, with words being written slightly different than they are in my Italian language dictionary.  Also, for example, the book of Eclesiastes has either additianal verses in the last chapter or the verse numbering has been changed and made longer. I've noticed this in other places in this Bible as compared to the KJV version.  Also translations change from English to Italian. I also compared the Spanish (Reina-Valera) version of the Bible to this Italian Bible and they are more similar. Over all i'm having fun reading the Bible in Italian.  The Word of God is beautiful in any language! God Bless! and happy reading.	2005-10-13

The COT report is unique to futures however Larry has developed another indicator that provides a similar indicator that is applicable to stocks and futures markets that do not have COT reports available. Exit criteria are discussed on numerous occasions. While entrances are subjective Larry mentions this repeatedly, saying that trading involves 2 steps: 1) setup, which the COT reports can help provide and 2) entry trigger, which he provides some simple techniques he has used over the years.  <br /> <br />While there are references to his advisory and educational services as well as the data/charting company that he uses they are not simply marketing gimmicks. When I study analysts, advisors and the like I prefer to be able to exactly duplicate their studies and verify them for myself and Larry's references are very beneficial in that regard. <br /> <br />Larry is truly one of the good guys in this oft misunderstood industry.

It is well written and easy to follow, however, given that career development is a hard sell to management, implementation needs to include evaluation of the program as well.  Without showing the benefits of the program to management, career development within an organization will be seen as nothing more than a generous perk.  Many organizations pay for employees undergraduate and/or graduate education - and that often is a generous perk.  But organizations do see that while the employee is still there in the organization, the training and knowledge gained from the education is benefitting the organization.  The same needs to be said about career development.  Knowdell does not provide a lot of how this can help organizations, other than perhaps as a motivation tool for employees.  If you need that info, you'll need to do extra work to look at what research says in that area.  Overall, career development and tuition reimbursements do attract the best candidates to an organization, are developed within the organization, and are retained because they feel valued by the organization.	2005-10-13

We need the compassion and the societal ethics that liberals affirm and the sense of individual responsibility and personal ethical responsibility conservatives affirm. Neither by itself is adequate.  Wallis has three parts to the book.  First, The Conversion of Politics,issuing in  a prophetic spiritualit.  Second, The Broken Community, dealing with consumerism, classism, racism and sexism.  Third, Toward and Alternative Vision, in which he lists seventeen \\"signs of transformation.\\"   <br /> <br />His call is for us all to become engaged in embodying the vision personally and working to embody it politically.  It is a challenging book, but full of hope.	2005-10-13

Most of what is in this book is already in Black Knight, White Knight. Except for the part about the affair with the married photojournalist.  She left him after 15 years (and somewhere in there her 3rd son committed suicide at age 22)because she met someone else.  However, the guy she's supposedly with at the end of the book, another photographer, she met previous to the married man. So I'm confused.  The printing style, without full justification, didn't help either.<br /><br />But she did give some brief information about being embezzled by her doctor and lawyer, and losing all her money.  Even though she didn't recover a penny of it from them, she was back on the street like she didn't miss a beat. It helps to have rich friends.<br /><br />One good thing about this book was the photos.  You get to see Gloria Vanderbilt not even looking like Gloria Vanderbilt (not so harshly made up and softer-looking). But the writing does seem dashed off and glosses over too much for me to give it but 3 stars.	2005-10-13
US	52423461	R2E6IQYQNE5MQW	0141019646	643055675	In Command Of History: Churchill Fighting And Writing Second World War	Books	5	5	5	N	Y	The Politician as Historian or Vice Versa?	I found this volume to be extremely interesting, even fascinating at times.  It focuses upon the writing of Winston Churchill's epic \\"The Second World War,\\" whose six volumes were a major publishing event around the world, and eventually earned Churchill a Nobel Prize for literature. It is really several different books in one. <br /> <br />    First, much like Ashley's \\"Churchill as Historian,\\" the author discusses the actual mechanics of writing so massive a project when Churchill had plenty of other things to keep him busy.  The \\"syndicate\\" of experts who assisted him, including even the Parliamentary Cabinet Office, is analyzed in great detail. According to the author, the \\"three D's\\" were the core of Churchill's method.  That is, first he had set in type the key documents which he had collected during his wartime service as Prime Minister. Then he tied the documents together with dictated reminiscenses.  Finally, the third \\"D\\" consisted of a very large number of drafts whereby the documents were edited down and the connecting narrative supplemented with WC's own recollections or papers drafted by syndicate members. Ironically, it is Churchill's heavy reliance upon documents that at once has yielded much praise from other historical researchers (since otherwise they would not have been made public for as much as 50 years after the war's conclusion),but also generated negative reactions from lay readers, especially in the U.S. <br /> <br />     Next, the really interesting issues are tackled.  For example, how candid and accurate was WC regarding his actions during the war?  The author extremely well documents how WC would edit documents, or even modify them, in order to (not surprisingly) put himself in the best historical light.  Also, he was duty bound not to reveal the existence of \\"Ultra,\\" which was the designation for breaking the German code during the war. Given the fact that in the postwar period, others were also writing books (e.g., Ike with his \\"Crusade in Europe\\" and Sherwood's \\"Roosevelt and Hopkins\\"), WC would frequently modify his drafts in order to obviate any possible taint regarding his decisions and actions while PM in a stab at vindication.  One good example was the dispute that arose over whether WC had favored or retarded the \\"Overlord\\" invasion of France in 1944. Churchill also faced the practical constraints of the Cold War being on-going and also acting as head of the Conservative Party and ultimately PM for a second time.  These factors too influenced how he structured the text. <br /> <br />     Of course a most intriguing question is did WC really write the work given the extensive assistance he received?  The author suggests a useful analogy: WC was like a master chef at a large restaurant who designs and directs the menu, while others do much of the actual food preparation.  He also likens it to a group project in science, where a number of folks collaborate on a paper which is attributed to the lead author. Clearly, it is Churchill's book even though he did not write all of it himself--but he reviewed every sentence and corrected or struck out that with which he disagreed.  <br /> <br />    Finally, in a most interesting discussion, the author recounts the arguments that arose during the 1955-1965 period as other historians, military figures, and the leaders of other countries (such as De Gaulle) took aim on Churchill's analysis.  Not quite as challenging as fighting Hitler, but still quite a nice war of its own.  The author, Professor of International History at Cambridge, has done just a superior job.  Be warned, it is a long book (over 600 pages) and the Penguin edition is set in very small type.  But the rewards of the book more than compensate for these problems, especially for those of us interested in Churchill. The stream of Churchill volumes continues unabated and has even increased recently--but this book should be singled out for the unique perspective it affords us on \\"the great man.\\"	2005-10-13

As a bonus, King recommends my standby reference on writing, \\"Elements of Style,\\" by William Strunk Jr. & E.B. White.<br /><br />Leave it to King, The Master, to write this semi-autobiographical expose on authorship craft in a more intriguingly unique organizational setup than anyone else could conjure or dare. Leave it to Him to force (or else) a (sort of) \\"how to\\" book into mesmerizing entertainment; to step into the job with a horrific grab about a kid suffering ear drum puncture; and to coerce an anomaly of styles and content to coalesce into a gestalt of genius which WORKS, period.<br /><br />How can a book on writing be riveting?? Read it and see.<br /><br />King includes only those riveting parts of his personal history which have contributed to his writing career. He includes only the necessary elements to \\"teach\\" how to spark and stir creative fires. He includes only the necessary keys to his success (amazingly, he does know what those keys are).<br /><br />I was impressed with King's exposure of his method of writing from a SITUATION rather than from a precise PLOT outline; I still find myself chewing on that daring technique (though I do still appreciate a strongly plotted story).<br /><br />I was interested in his examples of bad and good prose, and agree with his praise of other works, though I reserve judgment on a few of his criticisms, and have developed techniques to take breaks whenever I need them without permanently losing a creative flow, which I can renew at almost any point if I can set up the right conditions.  (When I break through with as many Number One Best Sellers as Mr. King has, maybe my opinion on writing will be as viable as his.)<br /><br />King has many times earned the right to have an opinion on writing and to offer it for sale. Yet, he has approached this project with genuine humility, which is, to me, endearing (sorry about the sentimental slip, Oh Master of Horror).<br /><br />What do I admire most about this author, which is evident in this book? I absolutely enjoy his regenerating honesty, his uncanny originality, and his demand of himself to toss reader boredom into a black hole and perform, within his printed words, 24/7 without fail. Also love the way he sincerely and humbly exposes his respect for his wife.<br />Given what this man has endured and accomplished in his life, he's earned the best type of REST available to a human being, and I don't mean the big \\"D.\\" He deserves to be quite proud of himself. He deserves to have his thumbs permanently posed in the sides of a vest, to sit back and smile at his trail of effort and result.<br /><br />What a gift that he would attempt in earnest to share his secrets of writing success. And his uncanny self-awareness allowed him to share clearly what those secrets are, in this valuable gift for the youngest as well as the most seasoned of writers. This I say as a 2 decades professional writer and previous English and creative writing teacher who has published various articles and finished and polished 8 fiction manuscripts and has another 8 + book-length works in progress.  I'm not EVEN near King's level in the marketplace (yet), but I am a highly productive creative spirit who knows how to maintain, ride, and design the flow.<br /><br />There's always more than one way to approach any creative endeavor, and my approach to writing is similar to King's in some ways, somewhat different in other ways (I can only compare, of course, to the content offered in this book).  This insight to King's techniques exposes what works for him and what could work for other, though of course not all creative spirits.  Young writers should allow themselves leeway in deciding how to tap and work with their talents.  Creativity should be allowed to flourish, even when establishing a personal method on how to use that force, and sometimes it's necessary to forge a unique path diverging from even the greatest masters.  When I was teaching creative writing in the public school systems, I asked my students to at least try some of the established methods of writing prior to setting any of them aside to break away from them.<br /><br />Another great book which exposes a writer's path and techniques (through a novel rather than through a unique how to book) is THE NOVEL by James A. Michener.  See my review.<br /><br />What I believe On Writing has exposed better than many writing \\"how to\\" books is tapping into the Right Brain.  As I've observed the styles of many authors of novels, they each seem to be almost \\"designed\\" by DNA to work in different precise balances of Right/Left Brain.  The Left Brain wants steps, plots, outlines, plans and structure to be elaborately perfect prior to that leap into the ozone.  The pure Right Brain wants only the chaos of riding a storm of the absolute unknown, describing it as it explodes into the presence of present time, constantly changing, churning.<br /><br />Bottom line, though, telling a fledgling writer how to do it is, for me, a frightening extension of my uniqueness, because I would not ever want to hamper the growth of a maverick creative source needing by its design to walk a path not taught by any master before him.  Possibly every \\"how to\\" book should carry a warning.<br /><br />This one enters the effort in fairness, with humility and honesty, and does not say or imply, \\"This is THE only way to write.\\"<br /><br />Thank you, Stephen, for sharing your personal and professional views on writing, which expose your adept use of both sides of the brain, highlighting your ability to slip into the quirks of the Right side in intriguingly clear ways.  Not all writers can explain how that slip into the ozone happens.  Great books have been produced with various balances of Left & Right.

In many other places you are taking a chance on the reliability and accuracy of reviews of activities, reviews, directions, etc. but I find this book is right on.

The restaurants were exactly as described.

Mr K is positively bubbling with enthusiasim.  Had it not been taken by Joe Namath a suitable title might have been \\"The Future's So Bright I Just Gotta Wear Shades\\".  But therein lies the problem.  Mr K comes across more like a passionate evangelical than a reasoned scientist.  Whenever someone is absolutley convinced about the rightness of his assumptions I become skeptical. <br /> <br />     If you're reading this you know the premise of the book.  Mr. K maintains that the pace of technological change (and by technology he means the really cool technologies, like infotech, biotech, and nanotech) is not simply increasing, but increasing exponentially, so fast that we will soon reach a point where man and machine have become one, and are brains are a million (or maybe a billion) times more powerful.  When this happens everything we know will have changed forever. <br /> <br />     Moreover, this is not someting that will happen at some vague time in the far future.  It's just around the corner.  Mr. K even gives us a date: 2045. <br /> <br />     While reading the book I kept thinking, What if Mr. K had written this in the mid 1950's?  Certainly he'd have backup for his basic premise--the changes that occured in the first half of the 20th century were indeed tremendous.  Take aviation, a hot technology in those days.  Mr. K would no doubt have observed that we went from Kitty Hawk to the Boeing 707 in just 50 years.  Projecting ahead, Mr. K would have concluded that the second half of the century would see an even greater rate of advancement, so that by now we'd all have our own personal flying devices, zipping off to Europe in just minutes. <br /> <br />    But that hasn't happened.  Certainly there has been signigicant progress in aviation in the last 50 years, but not like the 50 years before that.  In some says it's worse.  I suspect that since 9/11 the time it takes to fly from Los Angeles to San Francisco (from the time you get to one airport to the time you leave the other) may be longer now than it was in the 1950's. <br /> <br />    Why has this happened?  A lot of this has to do with social conditions, not technological ones.  Supersonic trasport never got off the ground (so to speak) in part because people didn't want the sonic booms near populated areas.  These same social factors may well put the brakes on a lot of what Mr. K predicts. <br /> <br />     It's not that Mr. K's book isn't based on hard science.  It's positively larded with science, so much so that my eyes tended to glaze over many times.  It's just that he doesn't seem very critical.  While he does acknowledge the existence of contrary opinion, he quickly (albeit politely) dismisses any cautionary thoughts.  Those who disagree with his beliefs are clearly stuck-in-the-mud, nay-saying Luddites. <br /> <br />    Mr K is obviously a brilliant, well-informed scientist.  I don't have enough knowledge to judge the accuracy of his facts, except in a few situations.  When that does occur, though, I become unimpressed.  For example, he spends a few pages talking about the increases that have occured in life expectancy, and uses this to project further increases to 150 years and then to 500 years.  But he fails to distinguish between life exoectancy and life span.  The former has indeed increased, but the latter has not.  I am certain Mr. K knows the difference.  His failure to make the distinction is misleading and disingenuous.  It makes me wonder about the veracity of the rest of the book. <br /> <br />     As to the book itself, it's far too long.  He repeats his points so much it seems as though he thinks that by mere repetition the reader will become more convinced that he's right.  And some parts of the book are simply annoying, like the smug pseudo-conversations among past, present, and future personages that appear throughout the work. <br /> <br />To his credit, though, his optimisim about the future is refreshing, and certainly an antidote to the dystopian views typical in literature and Hollywood (Brave New World, 1984, Blade Runner, Mad Max, The Terminator, Waterworld, etc.). <br /> <br />     The bottom line here is that Mr. K. doesn't seem to remember that virtually all predictions about the future are wrong, since the predictions are simply extrapolations of current trends.  The future is never what we think it will be, and Mr. K is no exception. <br /> <br />     Then again, he could be right.  If so, I just hope I can live long enough to enjoy the sigularity, so I can have my body filled with nanobots and my brain uploaded to (as he would say) a suitable substrate.  Maybe being a cyborg won't be so bad. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />     <br />	2005-10-13

I cannot imagine what it must be to have lost both your husband (and all he was to you during your 45 years with him) and your daughter.  I hope that the strength you have shown in writing this book will continue to sustain you and make your life meaningful.  I read your book through quickly, as your thoughts and reactions were so much like mine, and seemed a validation that what I was feeling was okay and natural.  I lost my 44 year-old son in August, after taking care of him for three months (he was diagnosed with an inoperable, stage 4 brain tumor in April, and we tried everything to save him.)  I understand the vortex of memories, appearing from nowhere, bringing you to your knees.  I discovered that the reason I couldn't sleep was that I was still half-awake listening for my son to get up during the night, as he did so often.  Closing my bedroom door has helped.  We spent so much time in the car driving to labs, the ER, doctor appointments - always with the radio playing the music he loved -and now the only thing I can stand is songs sung in Spanish - because lyrics that you can't understand can't hurt you.  So, yes, the book and the way it was written was, for me, an opportuunity to talk intimately with someone who knew how I was feeling.  It grates on me to read reviews of the quality of the writing.  This writing was from the heart, and it spoke to mine.	2005-10-13

The first ones, Templars and Hospitallers, were founded in the XII Century, after the First Crusade, in order to protect pilgrims in the Holy Land and to provide humanitarian and medical services. Soon, these monks became more warriors than anything else, true machines of war which came to be the first organized and properly trained and disciplined professional elite troops in the West since the Roman Empire. The West and Islam lived then (and still do) in a permanent state of threat and holy war. Although these warriors made vows of poverty, obedience and chastity, they soon accumulated enormous riches, fighted one another and their discipline, especially in sexual matters, relaxed.<br /><br />The first part of the books tells the two centuries of Christian occupation in the Holy Land, which the Islam had taken by force centuries before, and where, despite some resounding successes, the Christians ended up being totally defeated and expelled, to this day. The second part tells the story of the Crusade in the Baltic, performed by the Teutonic Knights against the pagan Slav Prussians, terrifying cannibals adoring spirits in trees, as well as snakes in the woods. These Teutonics founded what was probably the first \\"modern\\" state: Prussia (the German one). This story is practically unknown, in spite of being totally fascinating. The third part is the Reconquest of Spain, where the orders were crucial in defeating the Moors. Then come the stories of the Hospitallers in Rhodes and Malta -also wonderful- and then what became of the existing orders today.<br /><br />One striking common theme during the thousand years covered is the permanent and bloody conflict between the West and Islam. In spite of the torrent of names, places and dates, this book is an incredible collection of adventures and improbable deeds, especially the sieges of Acre, Rhodes and Malta, as well as the Spanish Reconquista and the Prussian episode. The tone of the book is apologetic, the author himself being a Knight of Malta, but it also vividly portraits the terrible atrocities committed by both sides. It fills a huge vacuum in the historical and political education of almost any reader, besides being an impressive saga of courage, dedication, violence, survival, glory, triumph, defeat and corruption at the same time. It really motivates you to read more about this subject.on of adventures and improbable deeds, especially the sieges of Acre, Rhodes and Malta, as well as the Spanish Reconquista and the Prussian episode.

In Volume 4, Masumi is off to study at England's Royal Ballet Academy.  There she must confront her rival, the fiery Sidney Ecklund, as well as overcome her own artistic shortcomings.  Along the way she also meets and receives encouragement from legendary ballerina Margot Fonteyn. <br /> <br />\\"Swan\\" is interesting is that it deals with the reality of ballet - auditions, nerves, endless practices, and injuries.  As a dancer myself, I can identify to some extent with Masumi's love for ballet and her desire to excel.  We also get to meet leading lights from the ballet world of the 1970's (when this manga was written and takes place) - Maya Plisetskaya, Margot Fonteyn, Rudolf Nureyev, and the Bolshoi Ballet. <br /> <br />What bothers me about \\"Swan\\" is its heavy-handed, soap-opera-esque, OMG EMOTION that saturates every page.  I know that this can be a regular occurrence in manga, but there are times when I wanted to smack Masumi upside the head and tell her to get a grip - the girl cries, as one character notes, \\"at the drop of a hat.\\"  But the most glaring problem with \\"Swan\\" is the lack of fact-checking.  The real-life dancers and ballets are misspelled or misidentified - \\"Margaret\\" Fonteyn, Maya \\"Prisetskaya\\", \\"The Hunchback Pony\\" (better known as \\"The Little Humpbacked Horse\\"), and who the heck is \\"WALDORF\\" Nureyev?!?  This may be a result of poor translation, but someone should have caught these blatant errors. <br /> <br />\\"Swan\\" is probably best for pre-teen and young teen girls perhaps dreaming of their own turn in the spotlight.  Older readers - especially those with some knowledge of ballet - might find it a bit too overdone.	2005-10-13

This asset-building approach to youth development and community development is solidly based on extensive research and meta-research.  Thousands of youth have been surveyed to yield the great information.  Written for parents, community volunteers and professionals who work with children & youth, it describes 40 qualities (or assets) which help youth thrive.  The more of the 40 assets a youth has the better he/she does.  A university student body president I knew felt he had 39 of the 40 assets; since I knew him to be a fabulous kid, it validated the asset-building framework for me.  I urge every parent to get and read this, apply what you learn to your kids, and then go out and make your community more youth friendly.  I have 3 copies; two of which are \\"loaners\\".	2005-10-13

More than 90% of the authors training material is right on the mark. But, I was disturbed by the fact that the author commits several chapters to constitutional law and a good deal of time on how to thwart the police in investigations. <br /> <br />While the author is certainly entitled to his views I felt a little mislead by the title. I am a firearms trainer and am always looking for new material. I had never read anything by Mr. Farnam before but he title seemed relevant so I bought the book.

Why do I then only give it three stars? The author explains everything very well. HOWEVER, for someone that's never used the router before, words often leave you fumbling. A picture is worth 1000 words and it couldn't be more true in this case. There are pictures. Just no enough of them and they're in a weird black and white and funny kind of red deal. Not very clear at all. So you often have two pages of words where one clear picture would have replaced all of it and done a better job. <br /> <br />The second problem I had was the fact that this book essentially ignores the plunge router. This is fine. He pretty much shows how you can do everything with the vertical and horizontal router table and the many, many jigs, fences and accessories. However, I bought a mid power (2 1/4 HP) porter cable plunge router and almost feel that I should return it for the 3 HP one which would have cost me the same amount of money because his bias seems to indicate the plunge router is not necessary. <br /> <br />Finally, the part where he mentions how to add a switch to your router table is confusing. Thank goodness I know how electrical work, so I could figure things out. However, SJT appliance cable is not something you can pick up at your local home depot. A source list on this would have been extremely helpful. <br /> <br />All in all, however, it is still a great book.	2005-10-13

I used the 3 glowing reviews on this product to make my decision in purchasing it. Before I gripe, I'll try to find some nice things to say. I was very impressed with the production quality of the book and the detailed information in the biography section. The transcriptions were note-for-note pretty good. The tab's a little off from video recordings of Django playing these same tunes, but the notes are right.<br /><br />That's about where it ends, though. The recording, while technically a decent recording, offers no insight to Django's phrasing or timing of the notes. There are entire passages where it felt like Rod was just playing the notes and nothing more. Other times, notes were missed, played sloppily or not picked up by the mic, leading to a sloppy, unrehearsed sound. There's an entire passage in the Minor Swing recording where Rod plays the most boring note-for-note reiteration of his transcription despite Django's clear swing rhythm and sliding techniques on the same passage in the recording it was transcribed from.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great book to get as a bio, and a pretty good one for the transcriptions. However, don't try to learn from the CD, because Django would probably be rolling over in his grave. Learn from the master himself, and those that came after him (Fapy Lafertin, The Rosenberg Trio, etc.). They are the real deal, and they will play it right. Copy them, not Rod.	2005-10-13

Let the buyer beware: if you are a person who cannot or does not like to read really, really FINE PRINT, then this guide is probably not for you.  It has by far the tiniest print I have seen in a book - even smaller than the \\"Third Ear Guide to Classical Music\\" if you are familiar with that one.<br /><br />In my first look at this monster-of-a-guide, I could not get beyond this tiny print and the overly-plain visual layout.  But, with another long look, the value of this unique guide started to stand out clearly. There is a reason for such tiny print - to cram in an unbelievably vast amount of information in one volume.  The All Music Guide is enormously ambitious in what is contains:<br />o  BIOGRAPHIES of over 500 composers AND 800 performers (unprecidented in one volume)<br />o  Fairly detailed PROGRAM NOTES for an impressively large number of works (not just the major ones)<br />o  Listings of 2-6 RECOMMENDED RECORDINGS for each work (but no comparison or explanations of the choices like Penguin)<br />o  ESSAYS on the major musical periods and forms (difficult to read these longer sections with the tiny font size!)<br /><br />The amount and level of detail of the program notes is impressive - giving musical history, perspective and minor analysis for not only a given category of work (say, Mozart's 27 piano concertos) but also most or all of the individual works!  These essays are not unlike those found in a CD liner notes.  So, with this guide, you can look up the background and musical insights of Mozart's concerto #20 as well as see what recordings/astists are recommended for that one concerto. The only other guide that does this is Penguin Guide.  So, now can you appreciate why this book has such tiny print and weighs a ton?  But, as enormous as this guide is, don't expect EVERY composition to be listed.  For instance, under \\"Beethoven\\" there is ample discussion about the string quartets, there is little text or recordings for the ten violin sonatas and early string trios.<br /><br />Another valuable aspect for many will be the biographies of the great past and present PERFORMERS.  This volume contains fairly detailed highlights of each artist career (2-4 paragraphs) AND a listing of their finest recordings for performers like Argerich, Grumiaux, Perlman, Perahia, Rubinstein, Horowitz, Galloway, Holzinger, Bain and so on.  (But some of your personal favorites may not be there - like Rachel Podger and Pamela Frank for me).  However, I found the performer biographies a bit dry with not enough juicy details about their lives, styles and sometimes quirky sides to make it really compelling and interesting.  (tip: one of the best books for fascinating personal stories on the great pianists is David Dubal's book, \\"The Art of the Piano\\").<br /><br />Also, keep in mind that the AMG is NOT a CD/DVD guide as it only LISTS a few recommended recordings and does not compare/contrast/explain them (like Penguin, Third Ear, or Gramophone Guides).  But, then again the title says \\"Guide to Classical Music\\" and not \\"Guide to CD's DVD's\\" like the others.  So, its a different animal.  But, I thought the AMG's focused recommendations were up-to-date and reliable overall, giving a good range of historic, modern, and budget choices.  All-in-all, a valuable addition if you already have Penguin, Gramophone and Third Ear Guides to Classical Music.	2005-10-13

Having read all 6 books in the series I can say that J.K. Rowling is nowhere near the quality writer that J.R.R. Tolkein and C.S. Lewis were. Second, I would never recommend these books to young readers because of the violence that gets increasingly worse in each succeeding book.  The books  characters, i.e. witches, wizzards, etc. use \\"good\\" magic and \\"bad\\" magic. There is no such thing as \\"good\\" magic. These books stir up an unhealthy interest in the occult and the blackness that accompanies it. Harry Potter and his friends also take great delight in the misfortunes of others and many times contrive to cause these misfortunes to occur to those they dislike.  I would not recommend it for children.  The books are mildly interesting, causing the reader to want to know what happens next, but the story drags on in many places which tends to cause boredom with the story.	2005-10-13

This is the best book I have ever read on Foucault, no contest--though one must be clear that Halperin is EXPLICITLY NOT attempting any general and comprehensive explanation of Foucault's life work and thought, which Halperin makes quite clear, though there seems to be some confusion below regarding this point.  In fact, the tone of some of the reviews only serve as a demonstration of some of Halperin's points.   <br /> <br />My main criticism is that I would go even a little further than Halperin with respect to Foucault's actual purpose or mission in _The History of Sexuality_.  I would say that, with volumes two and three, Foucault has shifted his purpose from a general \\"history\\" (hence the title) of the rise of \\"sexuality\\" to a deconstructive and very narrow focus on certain discourses in antiquity that ostensibly SEEM to mirror our own while actually being quite alien to it.  It just so happens that these ancient discourses are about men.  From this perspective, all the complaining of a small but very loud minority of feminists merely reflects a failure to understand what Foucault was doing.  He wasn't trying to give us a general history; rather, he became fascinated by how the ancient world's most familiar discourses (which are about men) could, in fact, be extremely different, by the demonstration and analysis of that difference.  As for general history, Foucault repeatedly refers the reader to Dover's _Greek Homosexuality_, which was published between volumes one and two, and which he just as repeatedly tells us he accepts in basic outline.  Feeling there was no longer an urgent need for a \\"history,\\" he gave us his actual second and third volumes.  Should he have given us a hint he was changing course?  He did!--in the introduction of the second volume.  Readers need to learn to be a bit more active--though, clearly, as original, good, and rigorous as the thinking and analysis may be, it does make for a rather uniquely structured set of books.	2005-10-13
US	50300020	R38JVUTO9F2M0F	1594200319	816807979	Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise	Books	3	31	37	N	Y	Very entertaining, but I have some reservations	Reichl's book, like her famous double review of Le Cirque, raises the probing question of whether the \\"best\\" restaurants truly have earned their titles by treating all of their customers as four stars restaurant should, or whether, instead, the four star treatment is reserved for \\"special\\" patrons.  With that question she delves into issues related to food, class, and economics from her unique and powerful perspective as the NY Times restaurant reviewer.  The reader cheers her reviews of Le Cirque, Tavern on the Green and The Box Tree, in which she took powerful restaurants to task for their failure to treat ALL patrons (rather than just the most well-known or privileged) with the respect and graciousness for which they have paid.  My husband and I now have the luxury of being able to eat at such restaurants from time-to-time (though certainly not regularly), and we usually happily get what we paid for.  But we *have* had occasional negative experiences like Reichl describes, and have seen others have them as well.  As Reichl recognizes, many people \\"save up\\" to eat at these establishments, or visit them for very \\"special occasions,\\" only to be treated poorly.  Restaurants who do not give the \\"four star treatment\\" to *every* guest (rather than the select few) are NOT, by definition, \\"four star\\" and do not deserve to be treated as though they are.     Taking this point one step further, Reichl also uses her reviews to make New Yorkers understand that truly good cuisine need not be expensive, and need not be French.  Her positive reviews of ethnic cuisine are educational and delightful.  In short, Reichl might be seen as the democratizer of the NY Times restaurant reviews.    However, at various points in the narrative Reichl seems to suffer from snobbery of her own (which she largely fails to recognize).  Her behavior at dinner with the man who paid for a meal with her at a charity auction-- showing up his food knowledge, expressing extreme frustration that he wantedto eat at a nice restaurant-- and her nasty comments about the young couple next to her at another restaurant, for example, exhibited a sense of superiority that seems to run beneath the surface of her narrative.  She acknowledges her poor behavior on these occasions through the words of her friends or her husband, but it would have been nice to see a bit more recognition of her limitations in her own words or discussion about her growth from these experiences.      In addition, the deep \\"transformations\\" that Reichl claims overtook her when she was in disguise seem contrived.  While I understand the need for the disguises, I (again) do not understand her need to \\"become\\" these characters and while \\"in character\\" treat others poorly, such as by leaving a cab driver no tip or making rude comments about others.          While I found the book enjoyable, Reichl generally likeable, and the restaurant reviews fascinating, Reichl offended me by including her negative views on, and review of, Windows on the World.  Writing in 2005, Reichl unquestionably knows that Windows on the World perished in the terrorist attacks of 9/11/2001, together with approximately 80 members of its dedicated staff who were on duty that morning, including its executive pastry chef and countless workers who undoubtedly took pride in their work at what was a pillar of New York.  They are the images we see in news coverage waving towels out the windows of the top floor, begging for rescue.  We have seen some of their family members speak on television about the delight some of them took from working at such a renowned establishment.  Her inclusion of Windows seemed totally unnecessary except to tell her story about dinner with the \\"obnoxious\\" charity guest she could not stand.  Did she really need to kick these people, or the memories of these people, while they were down?  How hard would it have been to edit out?         The book is very entertaining, and I applaud Reichl for democratizing the Times' restaurant reviews.  I just wish she had been a little more thoughtful about what details she chose to include, and how she chose to frame them.	2005-10-13

I've been looking for good reference books to help me really learn the correct way to stitch.  This book is at the top of my list!  I love the layout -- starting with the basics and working up to the most complicated techniques.  The excellent illustrations and explainations on the right and wrong way to stitch really helped me to see what I was doing wrong and how to stitch the right way.  And I know for a fact that the explainations on how to fix stitching and/or cutting errors are easy to understand and follow.  Whenever I come to a stitch I haven't done before, this is the first book I pull out! <br /> <br />Now, lets talk about the projects and pictures.  There's a color photo for each project in the middle of the book and a black & white photo with each project.  The charts range from beginner to advanced level, and trust me, you'll want to stitch each one.  The fibers and fabrics called for are pretty easy to acquire either from your local store or the internet; and if you need to substitute something, you can do so with ease. <br /> <br />I can't recommend this book highly enough!!  And if you have any questions about the designs or techniques, you can reach the author via e-mail and she's friendly and very happy to help.  Whether you're a beginner or have been stitching for years, you can't go wrong by adding this book to your library!	2005-10-13

Yockey's big opus \\"Imperium,\\" emulating Spengler and other such writers, was a know-all interpretation of all of history past, present, and especially future.  All very deep.  Yockey's other contribution was his admiring interpretation of Soviet Communism, but only after Yockey judged it to have sufficiently turned against the Jews.  This analysis, again, very sophisticated, very deep. <br /> <br />Yockey also had a knack of quarreling with just about everyone he knew, especially with those who shared his views.  When a fellow Nazi thought that he might not have purely Aryan background, Yockey shot back:  \\"My height is that of Adolf Hitler, my complexion is white ... you will give me satisfaction [at a duel] ... I shall flog you before witnesses. \\"   <br /> <br />Who would care about a nasty crackpot like that ?  Who would spend time researching all the nooks and crannies of that kind of life  ?  Well, Coogan did, and he deserves our thanks, at least moderately so. <br /> <br />Yockey's life could indeed have been a very significant subject if it had been used as an example in a wider study of the Nazi fringe in America.  Coogan gives us precious little of that kind of material. He does tell us something, for example, about the Nazi propagandist Willis Carto.  But Carto's interesting recent  history -- quarrels with other neo-Nazis, etc. -- are not covered.  Coogan is too focused on Yockey to ever tell us much about related persons and grouplets.  A broader focus would have made this book much more valuable. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, I am glad that Coogan did all this digging.  At least now we have the goods on one American Nazi, if not the whole phenomenon.	2005-10-13

But I think it would be exceedingly difficult to find a more thorough, better researched, more comprehensive, and better written automobile history, regardless of topic or marque. One may argue that there are more \\"important\\" cars (or not); perhaps the story of Daimler and Maybach's pioneering efforts, or Henry Ford's, are more \\"important\\" in a larger historical context than the activities of a relatively small maker of specialist sports and racing cars, but that's not what I claim here. I claim that this is the best WRITTEN, most thorough autombile history ever. Porsche, as an automobile and an enterprise, is a very special phenomenon, and Ludvigsen's book presents both company and car to an audience that may otherwise never appreciate it. If you don't like Porsches, then that doesn't matter. If you do, you need this book. If you're not sure, then this book may be the beginning of a lifelong passion for all things Porsche.  <br /> <br />That's how it was with me. I bought myself the much slimmer (but still hefty, at 860 pages) first edition of this book as a Christmas present in 1977. It was instrumental in changing my career path; it affected my choices in university engineering courses, and of a master's thesis. Eventually, six years later, I found myself working as an engineer at Porsche. Incidental to my regular engineering duties, I was often called upon to help some of the leading engineers in the company -- men whose stories I had once read about in Ludvigsen -- write English-language presentations and technical papers. This led to my career expanding to include automotive journalism, engineering writing and technical translation, but the passion for Porsche remains. I have three vintage 356s in the garage, and it was Ludvigsen's book that made me appreciate the virtues of these rolling historical documents. <br /> <br />Karl Ludvigsen is one of the few truly outstanding automotive writers of our time. I can think of only a handful of others who can compare in depth of knowledge and facility with the language (or several languages, in Ludvigsen's case) -- Paul Frere (also eminently multilingual, and a multilingual engineer) and LJK Setright come to mind. Being a bilingual engineer myself, I appreciate even more than most the job that Ludvigsen did in researching this book; his translations into English of many concepts and expressions from company-internal documents are faultless, and definitive. The subjects covered in Ludvigsen's other books include Mercedes, Ferrari, Jaguar, V12 engines, early history of Volkswagen, Indianapolis racers, and Can-Am -- all of which were done in the same outstanding manner. I mention this only because there is one overwhelmingly negative review for this book, posted by somebody who is very poorly informed indeed. That reviewer says \\"Mr. Ludvigsen glosses over the problems with the 356 and early 911 road cars...\\" Not true. When I went to work for Porsche, I found that I already had an excellent working knowledge of foibles and problems encountered with earlier Porsche cars, thanks to Ludvigsen's book. The reviewer also says \\"Mr. Ludvigsen glosses...the internal power struggles within the company and board, and so on.\\" Again not true. The Porsche-Piech, and other, battles are well documented. And the reviewer says \\"If I'd realized Mr. Ludvigsen had a past history of writing for Automotive Quarterly, I would never have wasted this much money buying this set. Just like Automotive Quarterly (which never had a bad thing to say about any automobile).\\" As for \\"never had a bad thing to say about any automobile,\\" I am an author who has also written for Automobile Quarterly, and I have to wonder if perhaps there is another publication of that name, because that's not the AQ that I know. I know this firsthand because among other things, I wrote what I think is a brutally honest history of the Chevrolet Cosworth Vega (AQ, 1989, Vol. 27 No. 3). Incidentally, the first, 1977 edition of \\"Excellence was Expected\\" was published by AQ.  <br /> <br />Bottom line, Ludvigsen's \\"Porsche: Excellence was Expected\\" belongs in the automotive library of anyone who seeks the definitive history of the Porsche marque, the company, and a chronicle of more than a half century of sports car racing history as seen from the perspective of its most successful practitioners.	2005-10-13

Fianc&eacute;e Holly Canton, daughter of the local sheriff of Palmetto County, has asked him to retire from the force. As much as she loves him, she's determined not to lose a second husband in the line of duty. Two years later, after several unsuccessful attempts to take down brutal drug lord, Carlos Santiago, Johnny capitulates and plans to devote the rest of his life to Holly and her thirteen-year-old son, Colin.<br /><br />Life doesn't cooperate, however, when Santiago stages a massacre on Sand Key, targeting Johnny. Holly and Colin are slaughtered in the crossfire. Johnny and his loyal police dog, Rex, are gravely wounded.<br /><br />Enter Enola, the strong, steadfast Seminole nurse who rescues Johnny and Rex from certain death and secrets them off to a tribal village to recuperate. A natural beauty and empathetic spirit, Enola contributes to Johnny's recovery with more than her knowledge of medicine. Armed with cunning tribal methods and the help of the village elder, Johnny struggles to beat the death sentence imposed by Santiago.<br /><br />Meanwhile, something's rotten in the sheriff's office. No one knew about Johnny's trip to Sand Key except the sheriff and his coworkers. Johnny suspects each in turn, until his investigative powers flush out the culprit responsible for leaking the information to Santiago and his band of killers. As he heals emotionally and physically, Johnny plots to take down Santiago's empire. The climax is replete with tension and nail biting action - the perfect and righteous revenge.<br /><br />There is much more to this riveting novel than a clever plot and magnetic characters. The prose is smooth and engaging, the dialogue is natural, and the sense of place is immediate. The Florida waterways come alive with gators, mosquitoes, buttonwood trees, exotic birds, and thousands of slow moving streams that snake beneath the mossy overhangs. It is with a sense of acute nostalgia combined with satisfaction that the reader turns the last page. Burdick possesses a rare talent - and is my new favorite writer. This book, much like its predecessor, The Margaret Ellen, A Karen Cobia Mystery, lingers in ones life for days after completion, leaving only one question to be answered.

Dr. Marcia Angel provide us interesting notes about research and development in some drug companies. An excellent book that makes one wonder why scientific community has to be encouraged to publish complete data about drug design, even thus some companies refused to do it. People deserve to know what is happening to choose a better way to survive in the pharmaceutic jungle. Also, a good book to understand the caveats in drug research.	2005-10-13

They are book-ended by classically-driven pieces [i.e., the Odyssey] as well as Renaissance works [Dante]. Hirsch brings his own personal experiences to these renowned works and coopts their voices. The middle sections do not work as well, as they  are \\"personal,\\" or adopt the guise of so being; and they somehow do not hang together cleanly. There are some good pieces, however, like the concentration camp art of children, but the very confessional nature of them is not as strong as the less personal beginning and ending poems.	2005-10-13

At last... a comprehensive visual compendium of the most celebrated artistic promotional film marketing campaign worldwide... almost.  You would think that the opulent Mr. Sansweet would have in his possession every single poster to have ever rolled off the printing press for this unprecedented franchise but several of my favorite foreign one-sheets, daybills, banners and bus stop posters are notably missing.  Does this mean that Mr. Sansweet has not aquired all of them in his envious collection of Star Wars memorabilia?  Not likely.  Chances are he has every single one of them... locked away somewhere within the bowels of his coveted archives.  Most notably absent is the lack of reference material specifically promoting Revenge of the Sith and would seem to indicate that this book was completed and ready to be published just prior to the film's theatrical exhibition, but there is a plethora of wonderful international promotional material such as the six character U.K. bus stop posters that are much more visually exciting than the disappointing U.S. domestic ad campaign that demands to be published.  This can only mean that another volume must be sure to follow.  Still, there are enough international poster variations out there to keep collectors like myself and presumably Mr. Sansweet himself scouring the farthest reaches of the globe and the galaxy for years to come.
This is a marvelous read, and those already familiar with the Abel Jones series will not be disappointed.  Again, I am amazed and appreciative of the amount of research that Mr. Parry puts into his novels, and this book is a prime example.  It is a wonderful story that not only entertains, but also enlightens about one of the most important eras in our history, and, one of the most important cities and cultures (New Orleans) in our country.  I couldn't put it down and read it all in one sitting.  Thank again to the author, and I look forward to reading about how the venerable Abel Jones will come to grips with his latest personal struggle regarding family over duty!
National Geographic Traveler is the best series of its type, and the NGT Thailand book has the same standards of quality as all the others.  It provides an excellent mix of written descriptions and beautiful pictures, both of which are helpful in determining whether to include places on your trip itinerary.  The only flaw is that the hotel and meal section is not particularly useful.
It is to Jane Hyun's credit to discuss issues of Asian American professionals on a very practical level. There are however, some caveats for the reader. The book needs to be contextualized within a larger conceptual framework. The overarching issues are ignored within her practical framework, namely: Who needs to change? Who needs to accommodate whom?  How much? What are the risks and benefits? Her book appears to be saying that corporate America needs to understand Asians, but it does not need to change.  Rather it is the Asian professional that needs to change and adapt. <br /> <br />Is the book too heavily assimilationist?  It is not clear as Hyun does make a distinction early in her book between assimilation (\\"adopting ...at the expense of one's own cultural characteristics\\") and acculturation (\\"adapting ...while continuing to maintain values, perspectives, and features of one's native culture\\"). <br /> <br />There appears to be little adaptation of any Asian models or perspective to the mainstream USA corporate culture -- page 279 suggests two ways: \\"Develop cultural competency\\" and \\"Make use of your bicultural and bilingual abilities.\\" While recognizing the dominance of USA/Western research and models in the business world, it is also logical and no \\"one model fits all.\\" Perhaps future research and practices can provide indigenous Asian models or perspectives that can be adapted and work effectively in coporate America or other cultures.  The Special Issue on China & India (Business Week, August 22/29, 2005) points out how some USA business models are not applicable. <br /> <br />It is not an either/or proposition.  By utilizing the juxtaposition of the Asian behavior/values system versus the Western behavior/values system to present her central thesis, Hyun creates a false dichotomy in the mind of the reader. Current business literature is filled with exhortations of \\"win/win,\\" \\"both/and,\\" \\"alignment,\\" and \\"interdependence\\" -- all very Asian concepts. These traditional Asian cultural values are at the very heart of what contemporary corporate America is trying to effect in order to add value. So there is a \\"baby with the bath water\\" caveat here to the reader.  The accommodation needs to be reciprocal, not unilateral. <br /> <br />In her Epilogue, Hyun encourages the reader to \\"Develop an Action Plan That Works with Your Persona.\\"  It seems throughout her book that the emphasis is on asking the reader to tailor his or her persona to that which is required for success in corporate America, not on utilizing the behavioral strengths and cognitive positions with which someone who comes with a strong Asian cultural background is imbued.  Being Asian -- it seems to Hyun -- puts one in a deficit position. <br /> <br />The reader needs to be cautious in the self-assessment, individual profiles, exercises and tools cited. They yield helpful descriptive self-awareness profiles and information, not diagnostic or predictive profiles, and they are dependent on situational factors. There are many suggestions, based perhaps on many years of experience, but empirical data demonstrating their reliability, validity or efficacy are not mentioned. <br /> <br />Kudos to Hyun for encouraging the seeking of regular and frequent performance feedback. This is a career self-monitoring technique that is utilized far too little by all employees to help document and strengthen requests for job and salary advancement.  In spite of the conceptual conundrums, this highly practical book is a must read. <br /> <br />Adrian Chan (Kochman Mavrelis Associates, Oak Park, IL) & Barry Mar (Management & Resources Associates, Seattle, WA) <br />
Champlin bravely asserts his own contribution to the great wealth of Neronian scholarship for the critics to pick apart. I find very little to quibble about.<br />It is difficult to write even-handedly about Nero for a Western audience. Who could forget the image of a man who \\"fiddled while Rome burned\\" or the terrible tyrant who had begun a nearly 170 year \\"persecution\\" of the early Christians, under whose reign both Peter and Paul were executed? As other reviewer comments reveal, you can easily earn the brand of a Nero \\"apologist\\" if you don't tow the party line, however inaccurate it might be.<br /><br />Champlin's thesis can be stated simply as follows: many, if not most of Nero's grandstands and outrageous actions, were performed out of considerable political shrewdness and calculation - not the madness or puerile excess wrongly attributed to a \\"live fast, die young, and leave a good looking corpse\\" emperor. Nero's success, Champlin argues in the first chapter, is evinced by a shockingly prolonged \\"afterlife\\" manifested in pseudo-Neros, Judeo-Christian apocalyptic writings, and a disenfranchised populace openly lamenting his death. Nonetheless, I cannot help but wonder, (working on the same assumption,) whether he had truly orchestrated his public relations as well as Champlin suggests given his untimely demise at age 30.<br /><br />Some reviewers disagree, but I reckon Champlin's original Nero-Periander link to be one of the most intriguing ideas in ancient biography I've ever seen. The ambivalent relationship with the mother, the Philhellenism, the artistic bent, and the numerous other links are too compelling to ignore outright, even if the conclusion a hard sell. Further research is warranted, but I suspect that Champlin, with his great intellect and energy, may have already exhausted all of the available evidence for advancing his thesis. He demonstrates the Augustus/Antony connections thoroughly. The discussion of the great fire of 64 is arrestingly well done: after convincingly presenting the defense for Nero's innocence, he suddenly shatters the deception in stating that despite this preceding evidence, Nero undoubtedly held direct responsibility for the coflagration. It hits you with dramatic effect almost equal to one of the primary sources comprising the centerpiece of his proof in this sudden reversal: Tacitus' Annales XV.67.<br /><br />Champlin's organization is somewhat bothersome as it is in \\"Final Judgments,\\" because he rejects chronological arrangement for thematic foci. This requires repetition of several facts, and I cannot understand his reasons for the chapter order. The post-mortem legacy of Nero, being most fascinating, he puts up front obviously to hook his reader. It serves as an interesting set piece for further discourse, because the inevitable wonder we feel about Nero's impression on the world ever after demands explanation: thus the rest of the book. But with Dio, Suetonius, and Tacitus unfolding the bulk of their own histories so methodically, the rearrangement isn't always a neat fit. Still, Champlin's brilliant weaving together of hundreds of sources, as before, vindicates his literary decisions several times over.<br /><br />Champlin, like any other historian, has his hypotheses and directs his evidence toward proving them. His presentation however, is replete with past scholarship and primary sources presented candidly and fairly. One of the most appreciable inclusions is the extensive collection of Latin graffiti, which add a critical dimension to our knowledge. This book has been for me an introduction into full-strength Neronian scholarship and I found it both accessible and empowering enough to read further with confidence.ngly presenting the defense for Nero's innocence, he suddenly shatters the deception in stating that despite this preceding evidence, Nero undoubtedly held direct responsibility for the coflagration.

This book has been fascinating to read. It is evident, as a student of comparative religion, that the author has done some careful research and integrated it successfully in the book. A lot has to be said for some major research flaws, such as often referring to Sufis (Islamic mystics) and Mosques, even though Islam wasn't to arrive for another 650 years! Overall, it is an entertaining book and will provide you with an interesting alternative for the life of Jesus, an alternative that is likely, not fictional.<br /><br />Enjoy, but do filter the content.
Although not quite what I expected, this book was far from being a disappointment.  It is not solely focused on women dressed as angels, it is mainly an erotic Fantasy Photography book.  9 photographers from North-central europe are featured, with more than 10 photographs from each.  Styles differ, from body-painting (for a comic-book effect) to completely photoshopped settings and landscapes, to a contortionist/dancer - but always the theme remains, the female in ways you probably have not seen before.
This book is a very good companion if you are using osteology blocks with pictures in black and white. Is just 32 pages and the information is limited, however the pictures are great and allow you to see the little details that escape from black and white photos in other books. Did I mention the price? Is very affordable for struggling students like me.

      1 nice book for the starters and great concepts to learn excel in an exciting way.

      1 Wollie Shelley is a mess.  Her life is overflowing with one thing after another.  She is a greeting card artist, is working on owning her own Greeting Card store, is dealing with a group of off kilter frinds (very, loyal friends), a brother in a mental hospital and an uncle who maybe should be.  Throw into this that she is part of a dating project in which she has to date 40 men in 60 days.  She has plenty to do. <br /> <br />While on a late night visit to the mental hospital to take her brother aluminum foil (read the book to find out why :)), she first sees a dead body on the way to the hospital lying in the road.  Since she fears that her brother has knowledge of it, or may have something to do with it, she takes no immediate action.  While at the hospital, she is taken somewhat hostage by a man pretending to be a doctor who is actually running from the mob, and has some knowledge of why the guy is dead in the road.   <br /> <br />What follows is a completely amusing and engrossing tale of how this all works out in a really fresh new way of doing so.  I found certain elements just a little far fetched (can't tell you what they are without giving something important away), I still found it a very good read and am currently reading the second in the series. <br /> <br />I found Wollie to be a fun herione with a lot of very real elements about her.  You can't help but like her and look forward to what she might do next.   <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book.  I did recognize that the author was an actress and do know who she is.  I don't see why some have made that an issue.  I think her work as an author and as an actress stand alone and speak for themselves.  I recommend her both as an author and an actress.
      1 While a little too old for the Spiderwick Chronicles themselves I can appreciate an interesting and detailed world for a series of children's novels. And I can always appreciate Mr.DiTerlizzi's art.<br /><br />This is good stuff and lets you see another world.
      1 This was one of the worse books I've read. I will not be buying anthing by this author again.
      1 This was one of my favorite childhood books, but I forgot the title and author, and finally found it, thanks to the booksleuth forum on abebooks  The story takes place in a fishing village on the coast (I thought it was New England but a forum member says it was England).  A girl finds a silver pen that writes messages from a sea captain ancestor.  I was captivated by the tale, and want to get a copy to reread (my sons, unfortunately, are too \\"old\\", but hopefully I'll have grandchildren in a few years to read it too!).<br /><br />  Bill Brown  Xiamen University MBA Center Xiamen, Fujian<br /><br />  amoymagic.com
      1 This is one of the best books on how people cope with Fibro that I have read. This man is honest about how he feels and how he struggles in his role as caretaker of an ill spouse. It helped give me insight into what my husband must go through in helping to keep me sane and well as this illness steals both our lives.
      1 This is an excellent book. It rates up there as one of the best how-to books on knifemaking I have read. Some of the knife designs are a little dated but the techniques described are still of value. The layout is excellent & it contains clear photographs. Covers everything from design, steel & handle materials to sheaths & final sharpening, plus a whole lot more. <br />If you can find a copy - get it.
      1 This is actually too soon for this review to be written -- I've only been pursuing the stretches (exercises) for a little over a month now.<br /><br />  On the plus side, I believe I can credit this book with helping me get through the last week or so -- in addition to a cold, I ended up dealing with back, leg, and shoulder problems after a day of tree cutting and trimming, another day of construction work on the house, and a third day of helping our grown children prepare their pool for winter storage, which included letting cold water run over my feet for two hours.  I've suffered from short hamstrings for most of my life, a condition that was finally diagnosed just last year, and any one of those days (besides the cold) would have previously put me in bed for at least a day.  The combination should have put me in hospital for at least four days.  Not to say that I didn't have problems, but thanks in part to techniques and stretches from Mr. Cooley's book, I managed to stay active and motile, and have now almost fully recovered.<br /><br />  To the negative, it could be that Mr. Cooley puts too much stock in his own discoveries, and he is certainly too used to working with people with already-developed athletic capabilities.<br /><br />  First, \\"too much stock in his own discoveries.\\"  The first section of the book describes how Bob Cooley survived a near-death experience, and how he came upon his stretching techniques while recovering for that experience.  I have not yet walked his path long enough to deliver a real judgement, but I suspect that part of the benefits he ascribes to his techniques is actually a normal part of his return trip from death's door.<br /><br />  This is not to say that there is no value in his stretching techniques, but rather that they may not be the \\"univeral fix-everything\\" he represents them to be.<br /><br />  The second negative is that I find his presentation better suited to those who are already developed athletically rather than the majority of us who are somewhat motion impared.  By his own statement, Mr. Cooley discovered his first stretching techniques while attempting a middling-advanced yoga position. His book also includes testimonies from several world-class athletes, which I certainly would not dispute.  However, I had to invent several \\"remedial\\" stretches before even attempting the beginning series of stretches presented in his book (fortunately I have some theraputic streching and hatha yoga in my background), and a few of the illustrations for the beginning stretches seem misleading if not plain wrong.  The intermediate and advanced series appear to be correct, as far as I can currently tell.<br /><br />  Mr. Cooley's basic premise is that first, streching is good and second, stretching against resistance is better.  Theroretically this makes sense, since then all the cells in a muscle would elongate rather than just those involved at the muscle's maximum extension.  Also, \\"resistence stretching\\" is very similar to what most of us do naturally just before or after arising from bed.  However, as noted in the book, the \\"immediate strength\\" of a muscle will decline if only his stretching techniques are used.  Again this makes sense -- from my observation, the existing strength of a muscle becomes \\"spread\\" over the entire range of motion for that muscle, and as the muscle cells and fibers elongate, the \\"new\\" portion of them is weak until strengthened through other forms of exercise.  In fairness, the book points out that the stretches can be turned into strength building exercises by reversing their direction, but the follow-through on this concept is weak.<br /><br />  I don't feel qualified to comment on whether his claimed connection between his exercise cycles and the \\"meridians\\" of traditional Chinese medicine is valid.  I do know that, while many of his positions approximate those of hatha yoga, the muscle groups involved don't necessarily correspond -- for example, the \\"child\\" position in both yoga and western rehabilitation therapy focuses on the lower back and Mr. Cooley uses it to stretch the upper back, shoulders and arms.  Not necessarily wrong, mind you, but a much different emphasis.  Also, the beginning series doesn't quite involve ALL of the muscle groups, at least as I understand them.<br /><br />  In summary:  The book's main feature is \\"resistance stretching\\" (which might also be described as isometrics in motion).  While not the universal panacea it's presented to be, the concept IS quite useful and beneficial. It should be used in addition to other exercise techniques, not as a replacement for them, and Mr. Cooley would do well to include a set of remedial \\"absolute beginner\\" stretches for the less athletic among us.  Meanwhile, I'm glad I got the book, and I intend to keep doing the stretches.
